# A supplier's record as a paid lookup: pay, then the JSON

A small server anyone can run. **Knos hosts none**: whoever runs it is its seller, and its price is its own. It
sells one thing, the lookup of a supplier's record ([docs/RECORD.md](../../docs/RECORD.md)), for 0.10 test USDC,
paid through the proposed x402 `knos-order` scheme of [`examples/x402_attested`](../x402_attested)
([docs/X402.md](../../docs/X402.md), "Record: a lookup priced for machines"). The record file itself stays free.

    python -m pytest -q tests/test_record_api.py        # two stand-in agents, the program itself, in LiteSVM
    python -m knos.record_api offer.json --records docs/records --memory .record-api --port 8402

The second line is `knos record serve` once the `record` command carries it. It reads the chain from the RPC URL
every Knos command uses. It has not been run against devnet.

| path | price | answer |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /records/<slug>.json` | free | the record file, as published |
| `GET /lookup/<slug>` | 0.10 test USDC | `402` with the order to fund; with a signed call, the record and what was served |
| `GET /orders/<order>` | free | how many lookups the order bought and used |

## How a call is paid

1. The caller asks with `Attested-Payer: <its wallet>` and gets `402` with a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header: the
   `knos-order` requirement, and beside it `extra.record` (the price, the lookups in a pack, the words to sign).
2. The caller checks it against its own limits (the program, the token, the most it pays, the terms' hash, the fee)
   and funds the order (`FundOrderWallet`). The money is in escrow.
3. The caller signs `knos-record:<order>:<n>:<slug>` with the wallet that funded the order, `n` counting that
   order's lookups from 0, and asks again with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`. It gets the JSON.

One order buys fifty lookups, not one. The smallest order `knos_pay` takes is 5.00, so a single order of 0.10 is
refused by the program (the test shows it). A pack costs 5.00 plus the order's fee: 0.05 under knos_pay 2.2, and
0.40 under the build that runs at the public ids until that upgrade executes.

## What is refused

- **A replayed payment.** A signed call whose `n` was already served. The count of each order is kept in the memory
  engine (`--memory`), so a server started again does not sell a lookup twice.
- **Another wallet's call.** An order's address is public. Only the wallet that funded it can spend it.
- **A call for another record, an order for another resource, an order with too little time, the fifty-first lookup.**
- **A record that is not there** gets `404`, and nothing is charged.

## When the seller is paid

The escrow pays the seller when the order's pinned judge signs an acceptance (`PayOrder`), the pack whole, and
returns everything to the caller after the deadline when none arrives (`RefundOrder`). The test runs both.

## What is not built

- **A judge for lookups.** No workflow exists that signs "these lookups were served". In the test a test key that
  only a test build trusts signs the acceptance. Until a judge exists a seller is paid only if the caller's chosen
  workflow accepts, so this is a demonstration of the flow and not a way to earn.
- **A refund of unused lookups.** `PayOrder` pays the order whole.
- **Netting across orders**, and any price below a pack.
- **Anything the free file lacks.** The paid answer is the same record, with the order, the count and the time it
  was served. A lookup built fresh from an events log is not built.
- **A run on devnet**, and a hosted server. Outside callers: 0.

## The offer file

What `knos.record_api.offer(...)` returns, as JSON: the seller's wallet and GitHub id, the token, the repository id
and issue the orders are scoped to, the workflow repository and commit that judges them, and the terms.

    python -c "import json; from knos import record_api as r; print(json.dumps(r.offer('<seller wallet>', <GitHub id>, '<mint>', <repository id>, <issue>, '<owner/workflows>', '<commit>', '<terms JSON>', url='http://127.0.0.1:8402')))" > offer.json
