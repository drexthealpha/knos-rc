"""`knos observe` against the programs themselves (LiteSVM, the test builds): what an outsider can infer about a work
order from the bytes knos_pay and knos_oidc wrote, and nothing else.

One chain, three orders of one organisation's Balance: a public one (reserved, then paid to a supplier), a PRIVATE one
judged by an attestor repository (paid to the same supplier) and a public one paid to a second supplier. Every
transaction is recorded as a cluster's `getTransaction` would give it; knos.observe reads only that record.

tests/data/observe.json is such a record, kept so docs/PRIVACY.md's tables are written from it
(`python -m knos.observe --render-doc`). Record it again with `python tests/test_observe.py` from the repository's root."""
