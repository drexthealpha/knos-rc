"""Take Sibyl away and Knos remembers nothing.

There is no second store, no cache and no fallback file. What the Stop hook learned from a past false "done", and
what the judge learned from a tampering pull request, live only in Sibyl's memory engine (sibyl-memory-client). These
tests break that on purpose and show the behaviour changing. Read this file first if you want to know whether the
memory is real.
