Thank you for the pull request. One thing to set straight, so that nobody waits for a payment:

- Issue #17 is a log written by a workflow. It is not a task and carries no payment.
- Issue #17 has no funded order, so no payment is attached to it or to work done for it.
- Knos pays only orders funded with `/knos fund`, on Solana devnet, in test USDC that has no monetary value.
- A payment goes to the Solana address or passkey its payee binds. An address on another chain cannot be paid.
- Funded work is listed by `knos work list`. The playground shows a funded order from start to finish: https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-playground
- Funded tasks anyone may take carry the label `knos-funded` there: https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-playground/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aknos-funded

This pull request is welcome as an ordinary, unpaid contribution if it is useful, and will be read as one."""
