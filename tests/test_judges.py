"""docs/JUDGES.md is the one page a judge reads, and docs/judges.json is the same page as data (scripts/judges.py).

The one sentence, then the pitch line, then the number; at most 350 words and one table; the six criteria in the
rules and the seven factors Colosseum's page lists, each one sentence and one link; days to approve defined and not
measured; five lines of what is not real yet, with the numbers docs/NUMBERS.md prints; no fee printed, because the public program ids charge
what the live build charges. README, STORY and WHY say why Solana in the same words.
