**The neutral meter for AI agent work: neither side keeps the count.**

Both sides close invoices on evidence both verify.

Of 241 merged agent pull requests claiming passing tests, 9 failed a test, build, lint or type check.

[Check](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/) · [Judges](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/JUDGES.md)

## The claim

Two parties who distrust each other compute the same bill from evidence a third party signed.
The program releases the money on that signature, with no company and no oracle in the middle.

Limits, in one line: Solana devnet, test USDC, no outside users yet ([docs/DISCLOSURE.md](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/DISCLOSURE.md)).

## The meter: two ledgers, one bill

1. Buyer and supplier each keep their own ledger of the evaluations GitHub signed.
2. Each runs `knos meter reconcile` on its own copy and rebuilds the same statement, line for line.
3. A line's policy is met, or it is disputed, duplicate or without enough evidence; only a line whose policy is met is billed. Each line then shows its four steps: policy satisfied, parties accepted, payment authorised, settled ([docs/METER.md](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/METER.md)).

## The money: released on a signature

1. The buyer fixes the work, the budget and the acceptance terms before it starts; the terms are hashed into the order.
2. GitHub signs the workflow run that judged the work, and a Solana program checks that signature itself before it pays, in test USDC. The smallest example is a bounty: a maintainer comments `/knos fund 20 checks: test`, and a merge with `test` passing pays the author.
3. Why Solana: Money is released with no custodian, and the count is anchored where neither side can alter it. A receipt verifies with no chain.

## The number

Of 241 merged agent pull requests that claimed passing tests, 9 had a failed test, build, lint or type-check job at the head commit (3.7%, 95% interval 2.0% to 6.9%; [docs/backtest.json](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/backtest.json)); 19 had a failed check of any kind (7.9%).
The scan recorded 16 and 30; 11 of the 30 were excluded on a second reading: not merged into the default branch, or the failure or the claim did not hold ([docs/index_review.json](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/index_review.json), method [version 1](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/INDEX_METHOD.md), counted by `scripts/backtest.py`).
The second number: 17.8% of first such pull requests, 147 of 826 repositories ([docs/BENCH.md](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/BENCH.md)). A failed check is GitHub's record, not a judgment of why it failed.

This page names no time for an upgrade, so that it is true before and after one. Whether a proposal is pending, has
executed or was withdrawn is read from the chain by `knos status`, the site's banner and the site's
[upgrade record](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/upgrades.json) ([`web/upgrades.json`](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/web/upgrades.json) is the
committed copy). The first deployment ([`programs`](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/tree/v0.3.24/programs)) has no upgrade authority and stays as a record; nothing
new is funded there.

<!-- capabilities:start -->
**Reproduced by someone else:** none recorded yet. **Exercised on devnet:** `verify_github`, `fund_from_wallet`, `refund`, `work_orders`, `order_pay`, `tests_mode`, `order_auto_accept`, `top_up`, `single_use_tokens`, `meter_batch`, `meter_seller_claim`, `passkey_funder`, `passkey_fund_relay`, `buyer_page`, `x402_knos_order`, `outcome_not_code`. **Deployed on devnet:** `verify_gitlab`, `key_guardian`, `fund_by_comment`, `pay_on_merge`, `hold_and_bind`, `pause`, `meter_single`, `passkey_payee_wallet`, `upgrade_gate`. Everything else is tested locally, implemented or not built: [the table with the evidence](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/CAPABILITIES.md) has one row for each capability, from [`docs/capabilities.json`](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/blob/v0.3.24/docs/capabilities.json). Deployed and exercised are counted only at the public program ids; what the 0.3.14 rehearsal ran at staging addresses of its own is in the note of each capability it ran, with its transaction.
