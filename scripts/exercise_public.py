status   hashes the executable of each of the four public programs the way docs/PROVENANCE.md does (sha256 of the
         program data with its trailing zeros stripped) and says, per program: the build it runs, the proposal that
         build belongs to, and the slot of its last deployment. Exit 0: all four run the 2.1 / 1.1 builds (or a later
         build this repository names). Exit 3: an upgrade has not executed yet: skip the exercises and ship the rest;
         nothing here waits. Exit 1: anything else (a hash nobody recorded, a cluster that does not answer).

run      for every capability of docs/capabilities.json below `exercised` that has a round here, runs the round in
         test USDC with the smallest amounts the programs take, and keeps what it sent and what it checked in
         <keys>/exercise_public.json. A round is a list of steps, and a step that is done is never done again: run it as
         often as needed. A step that needs a token a forge signs (a workflow run) looks for it among the tokens the
         repository's workflows posted; when there is none it prints which workflow to start, writes
         "needs run: <workflow>" and goes on to the next round. `--resume` reads the repository's comments again. A
         refusal is evidence of its own: the transaction is sent without preflight so that it lands and fails on chain,
         and its error number is held to the program's source.

record   writes that evidence into the repository: docs/capabilities.json (a capability moves to `exercised` only with
         a transaction that succeeded at a public program id; `on_chain` moves only for a program whose hash on chain
         is the proposal's build), docs/provenance.json (the slot each build went live), web/upgrades.json (read again
         from the multisig by scripts/upgrade_feed.py when --rpc is given; a proposal stays `executed` there only when
         the program ran its build), then docs/CAPABILITIES.md, web/demo_data.json and docs/PROVENANCE.md through their
         own scripts. Evidence of a simulated run is refused for the repository
         itself: it is written only into a copy (`--root`), which is how the tests run this command.

propose-oidc   after proposals 3 to 6 have executed: takes the knos_oidc build in --so-dir, holds it to the record the
         upgrade gate keeps on chain for its hash (the verified build), writes that build into docs/provenance.json
         (`next`), checks that the plan is exactly [knos_oidc] (any other program whose bytes differ from what is live
         stops it with nothing sent), then calls scripts/deploy_v2.sh --propose and prints the proposal and the time
         from which it can be executed.

The rounds use the code a relay runs (knos.settle.v2.relay.submit, verify_only) and the instruction builders of
knos.settle.v2.pay; in the simulator the tokens are signed by the test key the test builds trust (tests/_settle.py)
and the chain is tests/_order.py and tests/_meter.py.
