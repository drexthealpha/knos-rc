status   hashes the executable of each of the four public programs the way docs/PROVENANCE.md does (sha256 of the
         program data with its trailing zeros stripped) and says, per program: the build it runs, the proposal that
         build belongs to, and the slot of its last deployment. Exit 0: all four run the 2.1 / 1.1 builds (or a later
         build this repository names). Exit 3: an upgrade has not executed yet: skip the exercises and ship the rest;
         nothing here waits. Exit 1: anything else (a hash nobody recorded, a cluster that does not answer). `--json`
         prints the same as one object, with the exit code in `exit`.

run      for every capability of docs/capabilities.json below `exercised` that has a round here, runs the round in
         test USDC with the smallest amounts the programs take, and keeps what it sent and what it checked in
         <keys>/exercise_public.json. A round is a list of steps, and a step that is done is never done again: run it as
         often as needed. A step that needs a token a forge signs (a workflow run) looks for it among the tokens the
         repository's workflows posted; when there is none it prints which workflow to start, writes
         "needs run: <workflow>" and goes on to the next round. `--resume` reads the repository's comments again. A
         refusal is evidence of its own: the transaction is sent without preflight so that it lands and fails on chain,
         and its error number is held to the program's source.

record   writes that evidence into the repository: docs/capabilities.json (a capability moves to `exercised` only with
         a transaction that succeeded at a public program id; `on_chain` moves only for a program whose hash on chain
         is the proposal's build), docs/provenance.json (the slot each build went live), web/upgrades.json (read again
         from the multisig by scripts/upgrade_feed.py when --rpc is given; a proposal stays `executed` there only when
         the program ran its build), then docs/CAPABILITIES.md, web/demo_data.json and docs/PROVENANCE.md through their
         own scripts. Evidence of a simulated run is refused for the repository
         itself: it is written only into a copy (`--root`), which is how the tests run this command.

A round ends one of five ways, said per capability: `exercised`; `needs run: <workflow>` (a token only a forge signs,
or a step only a person does: the line says exactly what to start); `needs time: <when>` (the chain's clock: `--resume`
after it finishes the round, and nothing waits meanwhile); `cannot: <why>` (the release run has no means to do it: it is
said and never worked around); `failed: <what>`. A step done outside this script (a browser, node, a pull request) is
written down with `note` and then held to the chain: the transaction exists, succeeded, and names the program at its
public id. A fee is asserted against the rule of the build the PUBLIC id runs, written out here (FEE_RULES), never
against this tree's client.

rehearse --rc   the staging rehearsal of knos_pay's new build, as one command: the LIVE builds to fresh staging ids
         (deploy_v2.sh --rc), an order funded there, the staging ids upgraded in place to this release's builds, then:
         that order still reads as written and pays; the new fee (0.30 on 100.00, the 0.05 floor on 5.00); a quorum
         of two with ONE owner for both judges moves no money; with two owners it pays (on devnet: `cannot: needs a
         second repository owner` when there is none; nothing is sent in anyone else's name); an address funded again
         in the same second is not paid by one judge (the simulator's step: devnet's clock cannot be arranged); every
         open order goes back; staging is closed. `--simulate` runs all of it on the local simulator, starting on the
         test build of the live source (tests/fixtures/live) and upgrading in place to the tree's.

propose  after proposals 3 to 6 have executed: the plan is every program whose verified build in --so-dir is not the
         build its public id runs, and it must be exactly this release's set, [knos_oidc, knos_pay] (RELEASE_CHANGES in
         scripts/provenance.py); any other plan stops it with nothing sent. Each build is held to the record the
         upgrade gate keeps on chain for its hash, its bytes to the room of its program's data account (printed), and
         both are written into docs/provenance.json (`next`). Then scripts/deploy_v2.sh --propose, and it prints each
         proposal and the time from which it can be executed; scripts/schedule_upgrade.sh arranges ONE run for both.
         `propose-oidc`, the command of the release before, says so and does the same.

The rounds use the code a relay runs (knos.settle.v2.relay.submit, verify_only) and the instruction builders of
knos.settle.v2.pay; in the simulator the tokens are signed by the test key the test builds trust (tests/_settle.py)
and the chain is tests/_order.py and tests/_meter.py.
