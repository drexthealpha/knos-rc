actually say at the head SHA? Same agents, claim regexes and CI verdict as agent_pr_ci.py.

The weekly publication ("Agent PR Index, week of <Monday>") is the bounded sample (DESIGNS and sample_week below;
docs/INDEX.md, "The sampling design"). What follows describes the older whole-week scan, kept for a run by hand: each
agent, each day, every page.
GitHub's search answers 30 requests a minute to a signed-in caller and at most 1,000 results a query
(docs.github.com/en/rest/search/search), so the week is asked as agents x days (35 queries of up to 10 pages: at most
350 requests, about 12 minutes), and a day that holds more than 1,000 is cut in halves down to an hour. That reaches
7,000 pull requests an agent a week before any cut. Reading the checks costs about three requests a pull request
against the Actions token's 1,000 an hour (docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api):
the scan waits for the budget, keeps every answer on disk, and the next run continues. Nothing but GET requests to
GitHub's API is made, and no file of a sampled repository is fetched or run.

index.yml uploads index.json as the asset of a GitHub Release tagged index-<date> (a release, not a data commit);
network.yml downloads the newest one into the Pages site.

The scan searches each agent over date windows (GitHub caps a query at 1,000 results), drops PRs on repos owned by
the PR's author or the human who assigned the agent (self repos are not a market observation; the count is kept),
and classifies CI at each head SHA. It says whether it finished: `gate` refuses a scan that did not (a search that
ran out of time or was refused, pull requests GitHub did not answer for), so a partial sample is never published
and the run that made it fails where it can be seen. The build writes:

    {"date", "window", "n_prs", "excluded_self_repo", "definitions": {...},
     "overall": COUNTS, "agents": {name: COUNTS}, "prs": [...], "root"}

    COUNTS = {"prs": n,
              "any_check_failed":           {"prs": k, "share", "ci95": [lo, hi]},
              "test_or_build_check_failed": {"prs": k, "share", "ci95"},
              "first_pr_per_repo": {"repos": n, "any_check_failed": {"repos": k, "share", "ci95"},
                                                "test_or_build_check_failed": {"repos": k, "share", "ci95"}}}

Two counts, because they answer two questions (DEFINITIONS below is published in the file itself):

    any_check_failed            GitHub recorded at least one failed check of any kind at the head commit. That
                                includes checks that test nothing: a deploy preview, a title or label gate, a review
                                bot, a coverage threshold, a security scanner.
    test_or_build_check_failed  at least one of the failed checks is, by its name, a test, build, lint or type-check
                                job (agent_pr_ci.is_testish_failure). Always the smaller number.

`ci95` is the 95% Wilson interval of `share`. `first_pr_per_repo` counts one pull request per repository (its first
in the window), so one busy repository cannot move the figure. `root` is the sha256 Merkle root over the per-PR
records, so anyone can check that the published list is the one that was counted.

# asked for 10**9 an agent); (2) each claimed pull request cost three to four REST requests (the combined status, the
# check runs, the check suites when there were neither, then the pull request for its merge state) against the 1,000
# an hour the Actions token has: 250 to 330 pull requests an hour; (3) when the hour's budget was spent, each of its eight workers slept until the hour came back, and
# a refused search slept up to 90 seconds, six times; (4) the job that read the week waited for the six-hourly index
# job, which spent the same hourly budget first; (5) a week that was not read whole was refused, so the hours it did
# spend published nothing. Here: a fixed number of draws, one GraphQL request for 20 pull requests, no sleep on a
# limit, no other job in front, and whatever was read is published with its counts.
