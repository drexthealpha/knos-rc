# The upgrade drill: a program of the second deployment is upgraded through the upgrade multisig, on a validator on this

#
#   bash scripts/drill_upgrade.sh --from-devnet [knos_pay|knos_oidc]      (default knos_pay)
#       starts a validator of its own that holds, copied from devnet: the bytes of both programs as deployed (their
#       upgrade authority is the upgrade vault there, and so here), the Squads program, and both multisig accounts with
#       one change: each member's key is replaced by a key made for the drill, because the members' real keys are not
#       on this machine and must not be. Threshold, time lock and everything else are devnet's. Needs no key at all.
#       The validator is stopped and its folder removed at the end (--keep leaves both).
#   bash scripts/deploy_v2.sh --localnet --keep          the deployment on a local validator; it prints the ledger folder
#   KNOS_LEDGER=<that ledger> bash scripts/drill_upgrade.sh [knos_pay|knos_oidc]
#       against that validator, with the key folder's own member keys
#
# Steps (the first thing that is not as it should be stops the run, exit 1)
#   1 the cluster   a validator on this machine; both multisigs are as the design fixes them (governance.mjs show
#                   --check); the program's upgrade authority is the upgrade vault
#   2 propose       a no-op upgrade: the program's own bytes are dumped, written to a buffer and handed to the vault;
#                   governance.mjs upgrade propose, approved by the member keys given
#   3 too early     governance.mjs upgrade execute is refused by its own reading of the proposal; sent anyway
#                   (--unchecked), the Squads program refuses it (TimeLockNotReleased). The program is unchanged
#   4 48 hours      the clock is moved past the time lock (see "The clock" below)
#   5 execute       governance.mjs upgrade execute: the program was deployed again in a later slot, with the same
#                   executable hash, and its upgrade authority is still the vault
#   6 cancel        a second buffer and proposal, approved; governance.mjs cancel upgrade, by the member keys; execute is
#                   refused by the script and, sent anyway, by the Squads program (InvalidProposalStatus), before its
#                   48 hours and after them. The program is unchanged
#
# The clock. A Surfpool fork moves its clock when asked (surfnet_timeTravel), and that is tried first. A
# solana-test-validator has no such call: it is stopped and started again on the same ledger with --warp-slot. Measured
# with agave 3.0.0: after a warp the Clock sysvar reads the time the epoch began plus 0.3 s for each slot of the epoch
# (the runtime lets the clock run at most 25% behind 0.4 s a slot; from a snapshot it read 0.4 s a slot), and never
# less than before. So 48 hours take up to 576,000 slots inside one epoch, and an epoch of the default length (432,000 slots) can carry the clock 36 hours at
# most: scripts/deploy_v2.sh --localnet starts its validator with epochs of 1,728,000 slots, and a validator started
# any other way needs --slots-per-epoch 1728000. A warp starts from the newest snapshot, not from the ledger's last
# block, so the script waits for a snapshot newer than its own transactions before it restarts (up to a minute or two
# each time). The restart needs KNOS_LEDGER (and finds the validator's process by it, or takes KNOS_VALIDATOR_PID).
# The validator is left running afterwards.
#
# What it reads
#   KNOS_RPC            the validator (default http://127.0.0.1:8899); must be on this machine
#   KNOS_CLONE_FROM     --from-devnet: the cluster copied (default https://api.devnet.solana.com)
#   KNOS_LOCAL_PORT     --from-devnet: the validator's RPC port (default 8899)
#   KNOS_LEDGER         the test validator's ledger folder, for the restart that moves the clock
#   KNOS_VALIDATOR_PID  its process id (default: found by the ledger folder)
#   KNOS_KEYS, KNOS_FEE_PAYER, KNOS_MEMBERS    as scripts/deploy_v2.sh and scripts/governance.mjs read them: the fee
#                       payer and at least as many member keys as the multisig's threshold
#   KNOS_DRILL_LOG      a file that gets one line per step: its name, what was checked, pass (tab separated).
#                       python scripts/drills.py --upgrade-log FILE puts those rows in docs/DRILLS.md
#   PYTHON              the Python that has this repository's requirements (default python3)
#
# Needs: solana, solana-keygen and (for the restart) solana-test-validator; node 20 or later with
# `npm ci --prefix scripts` done; Python with this repository's requirements (pip install -e .).
