"""End-to-end PayOrder capacity: N relays, each paying fees from a key of its own, carry M payments to the end.

    python scripts/load_pay.py --relays 4 --orders 40 --simulate               # here: the path, every count; no rate
    python scripts/load_pay.py --relays 4 --tokens pay.json --wallet <keypair>  # the release run, on devnet

`scripts/load.py measure` times FUNDING only (FundOrderWallet takes no token): it never sent PayOrder, so it says
nothing of a payment's whole path. This does. One payment is what a relay does for one pay token: write the token
on chain, verify GitHub's signature (knos_oidc, several transactions), then PayOrder (knos_pay). Each relay has a
fee payer of its own, and a payment always goes to the relay of its part (`knos.settle.v2.relayq.part_of` of the
token's lane, the same partition the relay's workers use): two relays never carry one order, and no two relays pay
from one fee payer. Since 0.3.22 a pay token's lane is its ORDER (`knos.settle.v2.relay.lane`), so the orders of ONE
owner spread over the relays (the run of 8 Oct had one owner's 40 tokens in one lane, so one relay: 0.097 paid a
second), and `--fee-accounts K` has each order's fee go to one of K token accounts of FEE_OWNER
(`knos.settle.v2.pay.fee_account_for`), so the payments do not all write one account.

What is recorded, for every run: payments ATTEMPTED (the denominator), paid, refused (with the program's words),
never completed (no answer before the end), transactions sent, fee payers used; per relay the same. A rate is never
printed without its denominator and its failures, and p50, p95 and p99 are given apart, never merged.

--simulate   The committed test builds of knos_oidc and knos_pay in LiteSVM through the tests' own harness
             (tests/_order.py): M orders of ONE owner funded from one Balance, then paid by N relays in turns, each
             relay with its own key and tip account, each order's fee to its one of K fee accounts (made first, as
             `knos relay fee-accounts --execute` makes them). It checks that every order is paid exactly once, that
             each relay paid only its own part, that no transaction of one relay was paid for by another's key, that
             the one owner's orders went to more than one relay, and that each fee reached the account its order
             names; it counts transactions and compute units per payment. The simulator has no leader, no block limit and no other traffic: it gives NO
             rate and no seconds, and its result says so.
--tokens     On a cluster. GitHub alone signs a pay token (knos_pay takes no other signer for an order funded by
             GitHub's token), so the release run collects the pay tokens of orders it funded through the public
             workflows into a file (a JSON list of {"kind": "pay", "jwt": ...}) and hands it here. Each relay's key is
             derived from the wallet's own (as `load.py measure` does: a run that died is swept by the next), lent SOL
             for fees, and swept back at the end. Each payment goes through `knos.proof.ghrelay.relay_one`, the code the
             worker runs. Recorded: seconds from a payment's first submission to its answer, per payment, p50/p95/p99;
             payments confirmed per second over the run (first submission to last answer).
--scenario S  contention added to the same run, in the simulator and on a cluster alike (SCENARIOS says each):
             hot-funder (one funder's orders, ONE fee account, all relays at once), rpc-faults (sends refused or their
             answers lost, by a seeded draw, then retried; a payment is counted only when the chain shows it), priority-
             fee (SetComputeUnitPrice on every transaction with room; in the simulator on every other PayOrder, so the
             difference in lamports is the priority fee alone; a v1 transaction carries the same lamports in its message),
             burst (each relay sends all its payments at once; after a 429 or an expired blockhash a payment waits,
             BACKOFF with jitter, and is sent again over a fresh blockhash, BURST_ATTEMPTS sends at most; a resend the
             chain refuses because the first landed is a duplicate refused, not a failure; in the simulator every token
             is verified and open before the first PayOrder). On a cluster each signed transaction of a burst goes
             through knos.settle.v2.fanout.FanLedger: sent to the configured endpoint and to every --second-rpc
             (KNOS_RPC_SECOND), the same bytes again every 2 s, confirmed by its signature's status; a dropped
             connection, a timeout or HTTP 408 is no answer, and the payment is sent again (0.3.24: 22 of 40 paid, the
             other 18 lost to exactly these, each after ONE send). Sources for the fee: Solana's fee
             structure, https://solana.com/docs/core/fees/fee-structure (prioritization fee = ceil(price x limit /
             1,000,000) lamports).
--fee-accounts K   fee accounts per mint (default 1: the associated one alone). On a cluster the wallet is their base:
             make them first with `KNOS_RELAY_KEY=<the wallet> knos relay fee-accounts --k K --execute`; a relay that
             finds one missing names the associated one, and the run's record says how many it used.
