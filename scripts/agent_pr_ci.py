"""agent_pr_ci.py -- re-runnable market statistic for Knos.

Question: of PRs authored by AI coding agents whose PR body claims tests/CI
pass, what share had CI FAILING at the PR's head SHA?

Read-only: only `gh api -X GET` calls. Every answer GitHub would give again is cached under
~/.cache/knos-agent-pr-ci/ so reruns are cheap (a server error or a rate limit is not an answer and
is asked again); each invocation stops after --max-seconds and can be re-run to resume.

Usage (from this directory):
    py agent_pr_ci.py collect   # search phase (Search API, 30 req/min)
    py agent_pr_ci.py checks    # per-PR head SHA + checks (core API); then report
    py agent_pr_ci.py report    # writes docs/agent_pr_ci.json from cache, prints summary
Options: --end YYYY-MM-DD (window end; frozen in cache/config.json on first
run), --days 90, --windows 9, --per-window 20, --max-seconds 270
Delete ~/.cache/knos-agent-pr-ci/ to take a fresh sample (e.g. with a new --end).
