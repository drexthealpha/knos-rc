"""The money flows of the second deployment, rehearsed on a Surfpool fork of mainnet-beta: nothing here costs anything
and nothing reaches a cluster. scripts/rehearse_fork.sh starts the fork and runs this.

    python scripts/rehearse_fork.py --rpc URL

What is real on the fork: the USDC mint (Circle's, with its freeze authority), the token programs, the Squads program,
and the clock the fork was taken at. What is loaded into it: the test build of knos-oidc and the no-faucet test build
of knos-pay (tests/fixtures), each at its pinned program id. A test build also trusts a seed-derived signing key, which
tests/_settle.py makes and this script uses to play GitHub, and a test guardian; the released builds trust GitHub's keys
and the pinned guardian only, so they cannot be run here.

    1  the fork            which cluster it copies, its clock, the real Squads program and the real USDC mint
    2  the programs        both builds written at the pinned ids; the faucet is refused (this is the real-money build)
    3  a signing key       the test key registered with knos-oidc: usable at once
    4  a wallet            SOL, and real USDC from the surfnet_setTokenAccount cheatcode; token accounts for the payee and the fee
    5  wallet funding      the wallet funds a bounty with its own USDC
    6  a Balance           the wallet opens a Balance for a repository owner and puts USDC in it
    7  a bounty by comment  a GitHub-signed comment (test key) funds a second bounty from the Balance, verified on chain
    8  a payment            a GitHub-signed proof pays the first bounty: the payee gets 97.5%, the fee account 2.5%
    9  a refund             the second bounty's deadline passes (surfnet_timeTravel); the money goes back to the Balance

Every step prints what it did and what it found; the first thing that is not as it should be stops the run (exit 1).
The fork's clock stands still until it is told to move, and a move can land minutes short of where it was sent (measured:
up to about 190 s), so the clock is asked again until it is there.
