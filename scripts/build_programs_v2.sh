# $target is CARGO_TARGET_DIR when it is set, and programs-v2/target otherwise.
#
# A testkeys build also trusts two seed-derived signing keys, a test rotate pin, the test harness's repository as
# an attester and a test guardian (programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/pins.rs); a testkeys build of knos_meter opens credits in
# any mint and takes a test key for SetPlan; it is never deployed. The real build is
# built LAST for each program, so what is left in $target/deploy is the binary to try on a cluster. The binary that
# is deployed is the reproducible one (`solana-verify build programs-v2 --library-name <name>`), not this one.
#
# Each fixture is copied right after its own build: the next build overwrites $target/deploy/<name>.so. The hashes
# of the fixtures are pinned in tests/fixtures/SHA256SUMS; this script rewrites the lines of the ones it built, so a
# changed binary shows up in review as a changed pin. Run it again after changing a program id
# (programs-v2/program_ids.json, OIDC_ID in knos_pay), a pin in pins.rs, or any source file of a program.
