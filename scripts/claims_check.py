"""Check every number in the pitch-facing text against docs/facts.json, and every fact against its source.

    python scripts/claims_check.py --offline   # file-backed facts (the test suite runs this)
    python scripts/claims_check.py             # also the live facts: devnet and GitHub

Pitch-facing text is README.md and the home page's first view (web/index.html). Every number in
it must be one a fact in docs/facts.json says ("say"), and every fact must hold:

    {"say": ["17.8%"], "what": "...", "json": "docs/bench.json", "path": "market.index.overall.first_pr_per_repo.any_check_failed.share", "equals": 0.178}
    {"say": ["21"], "what": "...", "file": "docs/reference/TAMPER.md", "has": "fooled 17/21"}
    {"say": ["1,470"], "what": "...", "source": "https://...", "read": "2026-10-02"}      an outside number, cited
    {"say": [...], "what": "...", "live": "immutable"}                                   checked on devnet (see LIVE)
    {"say": ["4.03"], "what": "...", "doc": "docs/reference/MARKET.md", "source": "https://...", "read": "..."}   said in a document
    {"say": ["16"], "what": "...", "claim": "capabilities.exercised"}                    a registered fact (scripts/doc_claims.py)

A fact with "doc" backs a number in a document that is not pitch-facing (docs/reference/MARKET.md, docs/reference/REGULATION.md, ...): the
document must still say every number the fact lists, and the fact must hold like any other. Its numbers may be used in
the pitch-facing text too, so a number has one fact wherever it is said.

A fact with "claim" names a fact of scripts/doc_claims.py's registry, which computes it from its one source (the
capability manifest, the upgrade record, the program ids): "say" must be that value as the registry prints it. No fact is
a time: when an upgrade can execute is on chain and in the site's upgrades.json, never in a committed sentence.

The one sentence (SENTENCE) must be in README.md and the home page, word for word; what a work order is
(LONG) on the home page, whatever the line breaks.

Numbers that are not claims are ignored: versions, dates, clock times in the scripts, list numbering, names such as
RS256, an image tag's attributes, and anything inside code or a link's address. The generated benchmark table is checked by bench_docs.py.
Exit 1 on any number without a fact, any fact whose source no longer says it, or (online) a live fact that fails.
