"""One registry of the facts that more than one document states, each computed from ONE source, and the check that no
document says otherwise.

    python scripts/doc_claims.py            exit 1 and say, one line each, where a document contradicts a source or
                                            another document (the test suite runs this)
    python scripts/doc_claims.py --write    first write what is generated: the README's table of programs and every
                                            "stage" cell of a table of capabilities
    python scripts/doc_claims.py --facts    print every registered fact with its value and its source

The sources (SOURCES), and nothing else:

    docs/capabilities.json        how many capabilities stand at each stage, on which program ids the exercised ones
                                  ran, and the version each program runs on devnet
    web/upgrades.json             the upgrade proposals: which are pending, their builds, and the times on chain. The
                                  committed file is a copy (its `generated` says of when); the site's build writes it
                                  again from the chain, and `knos status` reads the chain itself
    programs-v2/program_ids.json  the programs
    examples/upgrade_gate/src/lib.rs  upgrade_gate's public id (its declare_id!): where an exercised upgrade_gate ran
    docs/bench.json               what was measured on devnet: the `[[stat: name]]` slots of scripts/bench_docs.py

A document states such a fact through a slot or a generated block, or in words that stay true as the state changes
("the live state is in web/upgrades.json", "docs/reference/CAPABILITIES.md lists each capability's stage"). What this refuses:

    counts     a number of capabilities at a stage, of programs, or of pending proposals that is not the source's;
               "nothing is recorded as exercised" while something is; a sentence that gives a whole release one stage
               ("tested locally and not yet on devnet"), which no source can hold
    stages     a table with a "stage" column, or "(`id`, `id`; stage)" in a sentence, that is not the manifest's words
    times      a time or a day for an upgrade that web/upgrades.json does not give for a PENDING proposal. A withdrawn
               proposal's times may stand only in the history (HISTORY), in a sentence that says it is history
    fees       a maximum for the fee, or the old 500 limit of an order, said as current
    payments   a total of payments on devnet without the day it was read; two documents with different totals
    slots      a slot nobody filled, and two documents that give one measured fact two values (bench_docs.py)

Nothing here needs a time that exists only after the release is pushed: that is the point. The one commit is complete
before the push, and what the chain says afterwards is published by the site's build.
