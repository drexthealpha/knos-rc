"""Writes programs-v2/testdata/adv_*.json: the scenarios programs-v2/handlers/tests/adversarial.rs replays.

The same recorder as scripts/rust_test_vectors.py (every call that reaches LiteSVM is written down, each transaction
as its signed bytes with what the program answered), over scenarios an opponent would try: accounts closed and made
again at the same address, the second before, at and after every time limit, a payment and a refund sent together,
one token sent twice, one judge alone where an order asks for two or three, one owner behind two judges, a marker
of the order that was at an address before, a token shown after a deadline it was issued before, and orders and
markers as knos_pay 2.1 wrote them.

    python scripts/adversarial_vectors.py            # write the files
    python scripts/adversarial_vectors.py --check    # fail if a committed file differs from what this would write

`adv_quorum_same_account` and `adv_quorum_same_second` recorded two defects of knos_pay 2.1 (one account counted as
two judges; a judge's marker counted for the order funded next at its address). 2.2 fixed both, and the Rust tests
that replay them are ordinary tests.
