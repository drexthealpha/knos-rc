"""The workflows a repository calls, as drexthealpha/knos-workflows publishes them, and the one commit of that
repository that everything here names.

    python scripts/pinned_workflows.py lock WHEEL [--write | --out FILE]   requirements/sign.txt plus this wheel's hash: the lock
    python scripts/pinned_workflows.py build DIR [--lock FILE]      write the published set into DIR (default lock: requirements/sign.txt)
    python scripts/pinned_workflows.py build DIR --source REQ       a rehearsal variant: knos installed from REQ
    python scripts/pinned_workflows.py tree [--lock FILE]           the git tree id of the published set: what a commit of it must hold
    python scripts/pinned_workflows.py stamp SHA                    name the published commit everywhere it is named
    python scripts/pinned_workflows.py check [DIR [--lock FILE | --source REQ]]   exit 1 unless all of it is consistent

The source of truth is this repository: .github/workflows/fund.yml, prove.yml, check.yml and attest.yml, where they are
tested. A repository names them by a commit of drexthealpha/knos-workflows, and a bounty records that commit on chain.
That repository holds copies and nothing else: the four files, requirements/sign.txt, a short README and the LICENSE.

What the jobs install, and why a release has an order. A job that signs, or holds a secret, installs from a list in
which every file is named by its sha256 (`uv pip install --require-hashes --no-deps --no-build`): every third-party
package (compiled with `uv pip compile --generate-hashes` from requirements/sign.in), and the knos wheel of the
release as the last line. That list is requirements/sign.txt here once a release is locked, it is written into the
install step of each such job, and it is published as requirements/sign.txt of the workflows' repository: the commit
of the workflows names the hash of everything those jobs install. The source workflows hold the word KNOS_LOCK where
the list goes; `build` writes it in, and a file that still says KNOS_LOCK installs nothing, so it cannot be published
by mistake.

The wheel's hash exists only once the wheel is built, and the commit of the workflows exists only once the list is in
them. So the wheel is built FIRST and ONCE, from the final tree, and nothing the wheel contains may name that commit:
src/knos never does, and README.md (the wheel's description on PyPI) is not a file `stamp` writes. The order, which
docs/RELEASE.md gives with every command (scripts/release.py runs it):

    1. Build the wheel once, reproducibly (`release.py wheel`): SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH fixed, the build backend pinned by
       hash. `lock WHEEL --write`: requirements/sign.txt gets the line `knos==X.Y.Z --hash=sha256:<this wheel>`.
       (`lock` refuses a wheel that is not the release the workflows name.)
    2. `build DIR` into a checkout of drexthealpha/knos-workflows and commit it there: its sha, S, is the one commit
       everything names; its tree is `tree`. Nothing signs from these workflows before this commit exists.
    3. `stamp S` here, then `check DIR`. The wheel built again from the stamped tree has the same hash (tested), so
       the ONE commit of the release holds the lock, the pin and the sources of the wheel at once.
    4. That wheel goes to PyPI before the push (`release.py publish`); then the push and the tag. release.yml uploads
       nothing to PyPI: it builds the wheel again, holds it to the locked hash, and fails unless PyPI serves a file
       with exactly that hash.
    A new third-party release changes nothing that is published: the list names what it names. Moving a dependency
    is a new requirements/sign.txt, a new release and the four steps again.

`stamp` replaces the placeholder KNOS_WORKFLOWS_SHA (or the commit named before) in examples/, in Knos's own knos.yml
and knos-check.yml, in docs/ and in the JavaScript client's README, and regenerates the site's templates (scripts/front_workflow.py writes
web/front.js from the examples). `check` says every place that disagrees.

The jobs that sign nothing (review and judge in prove.yml, and check.yml) install knos as the exact PyPI release they
name, with dependencies no newer than UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER. Before that release exists nothing can install it, so a staging
repository rehearses with --source: REQ is one requirement uv can install, such as
"git+https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos@<commit>" or the URL of a wheel. The variant differs from the published
workflows in that requirement and in how the signing jobs get it: their list holds the third-party packages by hash
and knos is installed from REQ after it, which no hash can cover. Its README says what it is. It is for rehearsal
only: a bounty funded through it is pinned to the staging repository's commit, not to the published one.

{note}The workflows that [Knos](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos) bounties pin by commit. A comment funds an issue,
and the pull request that closes it is paid from an escrow on Solana when GitHub itself signs the facts. A bounty on
chain names this repository and one commit of it: the commit its `fund.yml` ran at. Only `prove.yml` of this
repository at that same commit can pay it.

| File | Called for | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/fund.yml` | a `/knos` comment, or a new issue that funds itself; in an organisation's attestor repository, a run by hand or a timer | `knos command` |
| `.github/workflows/prove.yml` | a merge, a run started by hand, `/knos settle`, and the review after the check; in an attestor repository, a timer | `knos settle`, `knos review`, `knos proof judge` |
| `.github/workflows/check.yml` | every pull request (optional, read-only) | `knos check` |
| `.github/workflows/attest.yml` | a seller, by hand, after a merge: GitHub signs that a work order's terms were met | `knos attest` |

Call them by a full commit sha, never by a branch or a tag. The first three take no inputs; `attest.yml` takes a
repository, a pull request, an order, a kind and optional payees, which name facts and never code. Every job installs
{installs}, so a caller cannot change which code judges.

The jobs that sign (`fund.yml`, `settle` and `attest` in `prove.yml`, and `attest.yml`) install from a list in which every file is
named by its sha256, `uv pip install --require-hashes`: that list is written into the workflow and is also
`requirements/sign.txt` here, so this commit names the hash of everything they install.

The files to copy into your repository (`knos.yml`, and optionally `knos-check.yml`; for private repositories, `knos-attestor.yml` in one
repository of the organisation) are in
[drexthealpha/Knos/examples](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/tree/main/examples). Their comments say what each
trigger does and what the file can and cannot do in your repository.

Nothing is edited here. These files are copied from `.github/workflows/` in drexthealpha/Knos at a release, where they
are tested. In a checkout of that repository, `python scripts/pinned_workflows.py check <a checkout of this one>`
shows that this copy is the same, byte for byte.
