"""The acceptance receipt: one JSON document that says who signed what, about which artifact, under which terms, and
what was paid for it. It is derived from public facts only (the order, the judge's signed token, the program's
log lines of the paying transaction), so anyone can rebuild it and compare digests. docs/RECEIPT.md is the
specification; docs/receipt/acceptance-receipt.v2.schema.json (and v1) is the JSON Schema; docs/receipt/vectors.json
holds the conformance vectors.

Version 2 says four separate things, in this order: what the issuer authenticated, what the evaluator observed, which
policy produced the verdict, and what trust remains; and it lists every amendment of the order's terms with its
transaction. Version 1 receipts still check (`check` reads both), and `upgrade` writes one as version 2.

`check` is the whole rule set (the schema's shape and the rules a schema cannot say: shares add up, amounts add up,
the judge matches the order). It needs no package. `render` is the receipt for a person, under the four headings.
`mirror_write` / `mirror_find` keep receipts off chain (devnet can be reset); `attest` writes one as a Solana
Attestation Service attestation and never raises."""
