"""The zero-secret GitHub relay: Knos's public worker (worker.yml) carries the tokens that repositories' own workflows
minted to Solana, and pays the fees. Anyone else can run it too (`knos relay`); a relayer decides nothing. Each relayer
uses a key of its own (a token's account on chain belongs to the key that carried it, so two relayers never touch each
other's; two runs sharing one key do, and the loser of that race tries again on its next pass).

Transport (caller -> worker). A repository that installed Knos and keeps no relay key of its own has NO Knos secret, so
it cannot call the Knos repository or its API with auth. Its workflow posts the GitHub Actions OIDC token it minted as
a comment with its own GITHUB_TOKEN (`post_token` writes that comment, `found` reads it):

    knos-fund: <jwt>      on the issue, after a maintainer's `/knos fund <amount>`; and with it, on a line of its own,
    knos-terms: <json>    the bounty's terms (the token carries only their hash); for a PRIVATE work order, funded by a
                          comment in its judge repository, 128 hex characters instead: its scope and its terms hash
    knos-proof: <jwt>     on the pull request, once it is merged and has met the bounty's terms
    knos-bind: <jwt>      on an issue in the claimer's own repository named knos-claim (the pinned claim workflow)
    knos-key: <jwt>       on an issue in drexthealpha/knos-oidc-rotate or drexthealpha/Knos (a key an issuer publishes,
                          named by GitHub's signature); for an issuer that is not GitHub or GitLab the comment starts
    knos-issuer: <url>    with the issuer's URL on a line of its own (the token carries only its hash)
    knos-take: <jwt>      on the issue, after `/knos take`: the work order is reserved for the taker
    knos-cancel: <jwt>    on the issue, after `/knos cancel`: the work order's funder gives notice
    knos-revert: <jwt>    the accepted change was reverted inside the order's warranty: the holdback goes back
    knos-rule: <jwt>      the ruling of the arbiter a work order named
    knos-verify: <jwt>    any GitHub Actions or GitLab CI token, or one of an issuer the verifier holds a key for (a
                          registered issuer's, or a private key): verified into an account another program can read,
                          and nothing more; 20 a day for one repository
    knos-eval: <jwt>      an evaluation for knos_meter to count (`knosm:eval:`), from the buyer's repository
    knos-gate: <jwt>      on the "knos tokens" issue of drexthealpha/Knos, by program.yml's gate job: GitHub's word that
                          its runner built one program's executable (`gate:<program>:<hash>`), for examples/upgrade_gate
    knos-withdraw: <b64>  not a token: a passkey wallet's signed withdrawal (knos.settle.v2.passkey.request), on an
                          issue of its owner's repository named knos-claim. The relay sends it and pays its fee; the
                          money goes where the passkey signed, 20 a day for one repository
    knos-veto: <jwt>      the first deployment's, as before: a bounty funded there finishes there
    knos-claim: <jwt>

The marker only says where to look. What a token does is fixed by its audience, and so is where it goes: `knos:` to the
first deployment's relay (knos.settle.relay), `knos2:`, `knos3:` (work orders), `knosm:` (the meter) and `gate:` to the second's
(knos.settle.v2.relay, whose table KINDS names every audience it carries), and a key token (`knos-oidc:key:`) to both.

Posting the token in public is acceptable ONLY because it is not a bearer credential here: its audience names one
action, the escrow accepts it for at most an hour and guards each action against replay, and it is valid only from the
workflow commit the bounty pinned. Whoever relays it first only pays the fees; the money goes where the token says.

Discovery (worker finds the comments). Public reads, no install. The repositories the worker knows (those it found a
token in during the last two days, kept in KNOS_HOME; the ones in KNOS_RELAY_REPOS; the rotate repository; its own) are
read on every pass with conditional requests: GitHub answers 304 while nothing is new, which costs nothing against the
rate limit, so a pass every few seconds is cheap. (Past fifteen known repositories, the ones with the newest tokens are
read on every pass and the others a few a pass, in turn.) New repositories are found at most every 30 seconds: one
issue search for the word every token comment carries (`knosrelay`), and the recently pushed repositories of owners
served before. And without any search: once a minute the chain is read for every repository that has an open job or
work order (`watched`), and those are read on every pass, so the proof of a funded issue is found even when GitHub's
search is late or down. With no GH_TOKEN GitHub allows 60 requests an hour, which is one pass now and then, not a worker.

Result (worker -> caller). The worker cannot write to other repositories. It appends one line per relayed token to the
open issue labelled `knos-relay` in its own repository (its own GITHUB_TOKEN can do that):

    knos-relay <kind> <owner/repo>#<n> <token id> ok sig=<s1>[,<s2>...] [queue=<s>] [workflow=<s>] [wait=<s>] [chain=<s>] note=<what happened, in words> t=<seconds>
    knos-relay <kind> <owner/repo>#<n> <token id> fail <reason>

`t` is the time from the comment's creation to the token's last transaction. The four before the note say where the
time went, in seconds, each only when it could be measured (`stages`): `queue`, from the comment or the merge that
started the workflow run to the run's start; `workflow`, from there to the token's comment; `wait`, from that comment
to this relay picking it up; `chain`, from there to the last confirmation. (`wait` + `chain` is `t`.) The caller waits for the line that names
its token id (`wait_for`) and comments the verdict with its own token. A line with that id is a verdict on the token
itself, the same whoever posted it. A comment that holds a token it cannot carry (someone's copy under another marker,
or with other terms) is logged with `-` for the id, so it answers nobody who waits for the token.
