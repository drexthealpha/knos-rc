"""What an agent's message claims, as checkable kinds. Phrasing varies; the kinds do not.

    tests     "all tests pass", "801 passed", "the suite is green", "passes all unit tests"
    ci        "CI is green", "every job passes", "gh run view shows ...", "passes all CI/CD checks", "all checks passed"
    release   "shipped", "released", "tagged v1.2", "pushed to main"
    pypi      "on PyPI", "published 1.2.3"
    urls      any https URL said to be live / up / 200
    deleted   "deleted X", "removed X" (a path)
    author    "committed", "authored by", "no co-author"
    done      a bare completion: "Done.", "All done", "it's fixed", "the task is complete" (checked by the tests,
              when the repository has a test command Knos can find)

A claim is only what the message asserts; whether it is true is the checks' job. Some words of a pull request's
description are not asserted by its author, and claim nothing: an HTML comment (GitHub does not show it; a template's
instructions live there), the original prompt an agent quotes in a <details> block, and an unticked box of a task list
("- [ ] My PR passes all CI/CD checks": the author left it unticked). A ticked box ("- [x] My PR passes all CI/CD
checks") is the author asserting its words, and is read like any other line. The Agent PR Index
(scripts/agent_pr_ci.py) and the site's check (web/front.js) also read a ticked box as a claim, and skip "- [ ]",
HTML comments and the quoted prompt.
