"""Solana, as much of it as Knos needs: a JSON-RPC client on the standard library, `solders` for signing, and the
`Ledger` the relays talk to (knos.settle.relay for the first deployment, knos.settle.v2.relay for the second; the tests
hand them LiteSVM behind the same methods).

    KNOS_CLUSTER   devnet (default) or localnet. Mainnet is refused: the programs are not deployed there.
    KNOS_RPC       a custom RPC endpoint for that cluster
    KNOS_RELAY_KEY the key that pays the transaction fees (a JSON array of 64 bytes, or base58); default
                   ~/.knos/relay-key.json, created on first use. It holds no one's money and decides nothing.
    KNOS_WALLET_KEY a wallet for the commands that move its own money (`knos balance`, `knos fund-wallet`), in the same forms

A relay waits on round trips, so the Ledger keeps them few: `accounts` reads many accounts in one request, `send_all`
signs transactions that do not depend on each other over one blockhash, sends them side by side and waits for all of
them at once, and `now` is one read of the clock the programs see. The public endpoints count requests per address
(devnet: 100 in 10 seconds, 40 of them for one method; solana.com/docs/references/clusters): a 429 is waited out here,
never passed on as a failure.
