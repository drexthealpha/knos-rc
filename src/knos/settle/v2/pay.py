"""Client for knos-pay, second deployment (programs-v2/knos_pay): the escrow that pays the author of a pull request
on a GitHub-signed token verified on chain by knos-oidc. Pure instruction builders, audiences and account readers;
no network. The program is upgradeable only through a multisig with a public 48-hour delay. After an outside review the
plan is to make it immutable; no outside review exists today (`knos mainnet-check`), so today it is upgradeable.

A job is one bounty on one issue of one repository, funded from a Balance (`balance_pda`: money a wallet set aside
for the repositories of one GitHub owner, spent by GitHub-signed comments) or straight from a wallet:
`job_pda(repository_id, issue, source)`. Its terms are fixed at funding (`terms_json`, `terms_hash`). A signed token pays the
payee's bound wallet (`bind_pda`), else the address the pay token carries, else the job is held for the payee.

Tokens are verified with the second deployment's verifier client, `knos.settle.v2.oidc` (write_ixs, step_ix). Every
instruction here that takes a token also takes `key`, the verifier's account of the key that verified it:
`oidc.key_pda(issuer, n)`, which is also `oidc.read_token(token account data).key`. A token is refused once that key
is revoked (error 78) or has expired (77), however fresh the token is.

What a relay does with a verified token (anyone may relay; the money goes where the token and the chain say):

    fund  knos2:fund:...   the audience names the Balance it spends (`named_balance`): the funder's workflow chose it.
                           fund_balance_ix on that Balance, with the mint read_balance gives. On devnet, when it names
                           faucet_balance_pda(owner id): faucet_open_ix first, in the same transaction, then
                           fund_balance_ix on it with faucet_mint(). A fund token works once, only from its run's
                           first attempt, and a Balance takes its tokens in the order GitHub issued them.
                           With one compute budget instruction the two fit a transaction's 1232 bytes for terms of
                           up to 575 bytes; for longer terms (MAX_TERMS is 600) send faucet_open_ix in a transaction
                           of its own first: the token's marker then says MINTED, and the funding still takes it.
    pay   knos2:pay:...    for each open job on (repository id, issue) with the token's terms hash and mode:
                           pay_ix(..., destination(read_bind(...), audience)); create the fee account and the wallet's
                           token account with create_ata_ix first.
    bind  knos2:bind:...   bind_ix; then settle_ix for each held job whose payee_id is the token's actor.
    no token               refund_ix for every open job past its deadline and every held job past its hold.
