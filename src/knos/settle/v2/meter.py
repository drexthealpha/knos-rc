"""Client for knos-meter (programs-v2/knos_meter): acceptance without escrow. A neutral on-chain count of evaluations
that GitHub signed, for a buyer who pays a vendor by invoice and for a vendor who bills per accepted outcome. It moves
no customer money: each billable evaluation costs a fee from credits somebody prepaid. Pure instruction builders, the
audience, account readers and the statement; no network. The program is upgradeable only through a multisig with a
public 48-hour delay, until an outside review.

    open_credits_ix(authority, owner_id, mint, wf_repo, wf_sha)   # a wallet prepays for one GitHub owner, and pins the workflows
    deposit_ix(source, owner, credits, mint, amount, decimals)    # a plain token transfer into the credits (anyone)
    withdraw_credits_ix(authority, credits, mint, amount)         # unspent credits back to the wallet that opened them
    set_plan_ix(fee_owner, payer, owner_id, tier, rate, expiry)   # FEE_OWNER lowers one owner's rate until an expiry
    record_ix(relayer, token, key, credits, c, audience, now)     # one verified token = one evaluation; anyone relays
    close_mark_ix(payer, mark)                                    # the relayer takes back the rent of a mark it paid for

An evaluation is a run of attest.yml or prove.yml at the commit the Credits account pins, in a repository of the
buyer, on a GitHub-hosted runner, first attempt, whose token's audience is `eval_audience(...)`. It is billed and
counted once per (buyer, work order, artifact, policy, milestone), whatever the verdict; a later token for the same
is free and changes nothing while its mark stands (the first verdict stands). The first FREE_PER_MONTH evaluations of an owner in a UTC
calendar month cost nothing; after that FEE per evaluation, or the owner's Plan rate. Credits that cannot pay are
refused (error 118): nothing is recorded, and the same token can be relayed again once money is added.

What makes a retry free is the mark account, and the relayer puts up its rent. The mark names that relayer and the
time from which it can be closed: the first second of the next UTC month plus MARK_GRACE, when no token GitHub issued
in the month of the count is accepted any more. From then `close_mark_ix` returns all of the rent to that relayer
(`marks_of` finds its marks, `closable` says which are due). So a retry is free for the whole calendar month. After a
mark is closed, a token issued in a later month for the same evaluation is billed and counted again, in that month;
a relayer that wants an evaluation billed once for longer leaves its mark open.

Tokens are verified with `knos.settle.v2.oidc` (write_ixs, step_ix). `key` is the verifier's account of the key that
verified the token: `oidc.read_token(token account data).key`. A token is refused once that key is revoked (78) or
has expired (77), and always when the key is a private one (122).
