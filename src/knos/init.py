"""`knos init`: install the Stop hook and the `knos mcp` server for the coding agents on this machine.
`knos init --undo` removes both.

    Claude Code   Stop -> `knos hook proof --client claude` in ~/.claude/settings.json
                  mcpServers.knos in ~/.claude.json
    Codex         Stop -> `knos hook proof --client codex` in ~/.codex/hooks.json (Codex asks you to trust it once)
                  [mcp_servers.knos] in ~/.codex/config.toml
    Cursor        mcpServers.knos in ~/.cursor/mcp.json       (only when ~/.cursor exists)
    Gemini CLI    mcpServers.knos in ~/.gemini/settings.json  (only when ~/.gemini exists)

Nothing else is written. A settings file that is not JSON Knos understands is left exactly as it is. Before a file is
changed for the first time it is copied to <file>.knos-backup.

Knos before 0.3.10 also installed a memory MCP server and edit hooks (now in drexthealpha/knos-labs). `knos init`
removes those entries, so an upgrade does not leave a host calling commands that no longer exist. A server named
`knos` that runs `... mcp` with a command that still exists is left as it is (it starts this server); any other is
an older one, or points at a command that is gone, and is replaced.
