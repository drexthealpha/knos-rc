"""What the escrows' log lines say, read the one way for everything that counts money: the public numbers
(scripts/network_stats.py), the receipts, statements, SIEM export and invoices of `knos receipts`, the check that a refund
has executed (`knos status`) and the funder's record the MCP tools quote.

The programs print one line per fact, `knos:` lines on the first deployment and `knos2:` lines on the second, as
`<prefix>:<event> key=value key=value`; `knos2:terms <json>` carries a job's terms. A line counts only when the escrow
itself logged it in a transaction that succeeded: a line another program prints in the same transaction is not one.
`events_of` turns a transaction into events, `history` reads a program's transactions, `jobs_of` folds the events into jobs
(what was funded and what became of each). New fields in a line (a pull request number, an order) are read as they come:
every `key=value` becomes a key of the event.

Work orders (knos_pay 2.1) are the second escrow's `knos3:` lines. Their events are named `order_<event>` (order_funded,
order_terms, order_paid, order_settled, order_held, order_refunded, order_warranty, order_released, order_reverted,
order_reserved, order_cancelled, order_kill, order_topup, order_assigned), and `knos3:bound` is `org_bound`, so nothing
that reads jobs takes one for a job's. `orders_of` folds them into orders, each in the shape of a job with what an order
has beside it, and `work_of` gives jobs and orders together: what every count of money reads. knos_meter's `knosm:`
lines are `meter_<event>` (meter_eval, ...); `meter_months` counts the evaluations of each month from them.

The records for the person who signs off spend are recomputed from the same lines, never kept anywhere else:

    payments(events)      one row per payment (RECEIPT_COLUMNS), oldest first; receipts_csv / receipts_jsonl write them
    statement(...)        what one seller was paid in a month; invoice(...) one owner's month, as HTML and CSV
    evaluations(events)   one row per evaluation knos_meter counted (EVAL_COLUMNS): an invoice lists its buyer's
    meter_statement(...)  one buyer's and one seller's month at the meter (`knos statement --meter`)
    siem_events(events)   every escrow event as one JSON object (SIEM_FIELDS); siem_lines writes JSON Lines
    month_spent(...)      what an owner funded in a month (jobs and work orders), the figure `policy.allows` counts
                          against a monthly budget

Amounts are the mint's smallest unit, as the log prints them. Circle's devnet USDC and the faucet's test USDC have six
decimals, so 19500000 is 19.500000 test USDC and the files say "test USDC": devnet money, never real. The log does not
name the mint of a job a wallet funded itself; those are read as test USDC too, the only money `knos fund-wallet` sends
unless told another mint. A Balance on another mint is labelled `mint <address>`, and its text amount is left empty.
A payment whose funding is older than the history read still has a receipt (its funder and terms are left empty).
