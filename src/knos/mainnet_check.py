"""`knos mainnet-check`: what must hold before the second deployment (programs-v2) moves real money, each gate with the
evidence it was judged on.

    verified build      each program's on-chain bytes hash to this repository's verified build (solana-verify in
                        program.yml; or the files in KNOS_VERIFIED_DIR, for a build made on this machine)
    upgrade authority   each program's upgrade authority is the pinned vault; or none, once the outside review is
                        done and the program has been made immutable
    security.txt        each binary embeds a security.txt
    upgrade multisig    that vault is vault 0 of the pinned Squads v4 multisig; the multisig's time lock is 172800
                        seconds (an upgrade waits 48 hours in public after it is approved); it has no config
                        authority (no single key can change its members, its threshold or that delay)
    guardian            the GUARDIAN both programs name is vault 0 of the pinned guardian multisig, which has no
                        config authority either
    workflow pins       the commits of the rotate and claim workflows that the programs pin are in the on-chain
                        binaries and exist on GitHub
    GitHub's keys       every key GitHub publishes today has a key account that verifies now: registered, ready, a
                        genesis key or approved by the guardian, not revoked, not expired; with each one's expiry
    other clusters      the two program ids are in use on no other public cluster (an address is derived from the
                        program id, so a token for one cluster then names nothing on another)
    program checks      the last program.yml run on main passed: Wycheproof vectors, the differential test against
                        OpenSSL, the property tests, the fuzz walks, cargo-audit
    outside review      docs/review.json records one, and it is of the bytes on chain. There is none today: FAILS
    mainnet             locked, by design, until every gate above passes

The review is recorded as:

    {"reviewer": "who", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "report": "https://...", "commit": "<the commit reviewed>",
     "programs": {"knos_oidc": "<executable hash reviewed>", "knos_pay": "<executable hash reviewed>"}}

Exit 1 while any gate fails. A gate that cannot be checked from where the command runs (the verified build and the
program checks read program.yml's runs through `gh`; the review is a file of the repository) is shown as SKIP with
"not checked from here: needs a clone", and is not a failure: from a pip install most gates are checked and those
are not, and the summary line says how many. Run it in a clone of the repository for every gate. All I/O goes through
`Fetch`, so tests inject fakes.

`knos status` (status() below) is the shorter question asked of a deployment that is meant to be running now, read from
chain, each line with what to do when it fails:

    program ids         the two pinned ids are deployed and executable
    upgrade authority   each program's upgrade authority is the upgrade vault (or none, once made immutable)
    upgrade multisig    its time lock is 172800 seconds and it has no config authority
    upgrade proposal    no upgrade (or change) is pending on the upgrade multisig; one that is, with its index, the
                        buffer and when it can execute (the Squads accounts are read as scripts/governance.mjs
                        documents them: see `proposals`)
    guardian            the GUARDIAN both programs name is vault 0 of the pinned guardian multisig
    GitHub's keys       every key GitHub publishes today is registered, usable now and more than 7 days from expiry
    key refresh         the last Refresh of a key is under 7 days old (a key lives 30 days from its last one)
    new funding         not paused
    first deployment    both programs of the first deployment still have no upgrade authority
    refund              a refund has executed on the second deployment's knos_pay, in its newest transactions
