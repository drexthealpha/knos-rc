"""What a funder buys: the terms of one bounty, fixed when it is funded.

The funding instruction carries these bytes. knos-pay keeps their sha256 in the job, logs the JSON, and pays only on a
token that carries the same hash, so what is written here is public and cannot change afterwards.

    {"accept":"","checks":[{"app":15368,"name":"test"}],"deny":[".github/**",".knos/**"],"mode":"merge","paths":[],"reserve":7,"v":1}

The canonical form (the only one `parse` reads): one JSON object with exactly these keys, sorted; separators "," and
":"; ASCII, everything else written \\uXXXX as Python's json writes it; every list sorted by code point with no repeat;
at most 600 bytes.

    checks    what must have concluded `success` at the merged pull request's head commit, each with the GitHub App
              that must have produced it: its id; 0 for a commit status with that context; -1 for any source (a
              branch rule that names no source allows exactly that)
    paths     when not empty, every changed file must match one of these globs
    deny      no changed file may match one of these (so a pull request cannot edit the checks that judge it)
    accept    tests mode: the hash of .knos/acceptance/<issue>/ (knos.judge.checks_hash); empty in merge mode
    reserve   days a `/knos take` reservation lasts (0: the issue cannot be reserved)

Globs are GitHub's own, as in a workflow's `paths:` filter: `*` stays inside one directory, `**` crosses them, `?` is
one character, and a pattern ending in `/` means everything under that directory.

What decides a payment is `accepted`: every required check `passed` at that commit and no changed file out of scope.
The words of a pull request's description never change what is required. The readers of GitHub are at the bottom,
each with an injected `get(path)` (knos.judge.github): they are the only functions here that are not pure.
