"""The judge: prove.yml's `check` job. It decides whether a pull request may be paid, and the pull request cannot
weaken what it is judged by.

Two verdicts:

    gate(...)    every bounty pull request, before merge, running NO pull request code: the repository's own rules
                 (CONTRIBUTING.md, parsed once and kept in Sibyl), what this repository's history made required
                 (tampering caught before, also Sibyl), and the pull request's own words: a description saying "tests
                 pass" or "CI is green" is checked against the commit's finished checks on GitHub.
    judge(...)   tests mode (.knos/acceptance/<issue>/ exists on the base): the funder's acceptance checks, run in a
                 sandbox, must fail on the base and pass on the pull request.

What judge() enforces:

    protected     the pull request may not touch .knos/**, .github/**, the test directories or the files that decide
                  how tests run (proof.toml `protected = [...]` replaces the list).
    overlay       the run happens on the pull request's source with the base's tests and test configuration copied
                  over it.
    sandbox       every command that runs pull request code (its dependency install, its tests) runs as another user
                  (uid 65534), with an empty environment, and the tests run with no network. So that code cannot
                  write the judge's files, its memory, the job's outputs, or call out. `--sandbox require` (what
                  prove.yml passes) refuses to judge without it.
    sentinel      a random-named passing test and a random-named failing canary are added; the report must show the
                  sentinel passed and the canary failed, or the runner was faked or patched to pass everything.
    fail-to-pass  every acceptance check passes on the pull request and at least one fails on the base; every other
                  test that passed on the base still passes; the pull request collects no fewer tests than the base.

Languages (picked from the acceptance bundle's files, or `runner = "..."` in .knos/proof.toml):

    python   pytest, JUnit report                      acceptance: .knos/acceptance/<issue>/test_*.py
    node     `node --test`, JUnit report               acceptance: *.test.js / .mjs / .cjs / .ts
    go       `go test -json`                           acceptance: *_test.go (one package)
    rust     `cargo test`                              acceptance: *.rs, built as integration tests
    command  any language or framework                 acceptance: a `check` script (or `[judge] run = "..."`);
                                                       exit 0 means done. No sentinel in this mode.
    blackbox any language, and forgery-proof           acceptance: a `blackbox` script that runs as the judge and
                                                       reaches the pull request's code only through "$KNOS_RUN ..."

What is and is not stopped (docs/SECURITY.md says the same): in the first five runners the code under test shares a
process with the test runner, so a pull request written to forge the runner's report from inside is not stopped by
the report alone. The blackbox runner closes that: the check never loads the pull request's code, so nothing that
code does can change the verdict except producing the right output. An implementation that special-cases fixed
example inputs passes any check made of fixed examples; a blackbox check with generated inputs does not have that
weakness either. For everything else there is the review window, in which the funder can veto a tests-mode payment,
and the default mode, which pays on a maintainer's merge instead.
