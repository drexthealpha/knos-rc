"""knos reproduce: re-run, from a clean install and against public things only, what Knos says it does, and write a report.

    knos reproduce [--only ID ...] [--rpc URL] [--out report.json] [--own-repo OWNER/NAME]

Five checks, each timed, each naming the capabilities of docs/capabilities.json it supports:

    payment    a named payment on devnet (the `order_pay` transaction of docs/capabilities.json) is read from the chain and
               its token re-verified here: GitHub's RS256 signature (against the key the chain holds at an address derived
               from the key, and against GitHub's published keys while GitHub still publishes that one), the audience (this
               order, these payees), and the terms hash (sha256 of the terms the order logged when it was funded)
    programs   every pinned program's bytes on devnet hash to what the release names (the upgrade feed), and the upgrade
               multisig's state is read from the chain: a pending upgrade's buffer hashes to the build the feed names and
               has an execution time; an executed one is what the program runs
    simulator  from a source checkout: the local simulator's money invariants (tests/test_double_pay.py and the state
               machine at its default budget). From an installed wheel there are no tests: skipped, and said
    claim      `knos check` on a named public pull request gives the verdict recorded in docs/agent_pr_ci.json
    own_repo   only with --own-repo and a GitHub token: one funded round in the reproducer's own repository (fund by
               comment from the faucet Balance, pull request, merge, paid). It opens and merges a pull request there, so it
               is never run unasked

A check ends `pass`, `fail` or `skipped` (it could not be asked: no network, no checkout, no token). Only `pass` counts.

A report is made self-proving by GitHub, not by its author: examples/knos-reproduce.yml runs this command in the
reproducer's repository and asks GitHub for an OIDC token whose audience is `knos-repro:<sha256 of the report>`. The token
says which repository and account ran it; the audience says for which bytes. `verified` checks such a pair with no
network, given GitHub's keys: scripts/capabilities.py and .github/workflows/reproductions.yml both call it.

What the token does not say: that the workflow file was the example unchanged. It names the workflow and its commit
(`workflow_ref`, `workflow_sha`), which anyone can read in that repository.

This module imports nothing outside the standard library until a check runs: the workflow that verifies a pull request's
reproduction runs it on a bare Python.
