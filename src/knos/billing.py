"""The billing rule, as code: what one customer owes for one month, line by line, with the rule behind each line.

    a month's invoice = Control + Meter + Acceptance on value reconciled off chain + Record lookups

The price book (docs/MARKET.md, section 3; BOOK below is the same six lines, five columns each):

    Check       free, forever
    Meter       100,000 evaluations a month free per organisation, then 0.002 USD
    Acceptance  0.30% of value released or reconciled against a signed acceptance; by contract 0.20% on monthly
                value above 1M, and never lower; outcomes under 20 USD are netted: one release per payee per
                period, 0.30% of the netted amount, the 0.05 floor once per release; no cap
    Record      0.10 USD a lookup through the machine-priced API, paid per call by the caller
    Control     Team 25,000 USD a year; Business 100,000; Enterprise from 400,000
    Pilot       2,500 USD, credited against year one

The rules, each of which a line of the invoice names:

- Value released on chain paid its Acceptance fee there, to the program, at release. It is never charged again:
  a customer-month says which accepted deliverables were released on chain, and the invoice leaves them out.
- The volume rates are marginal and by contract: a Control plan is the contract. The month's accepted value is
  laid end to end, value released on chain first; each deliverable pays the rate of the part of the month it lies
  in, and at least 0.05. On chain the program takes 0.30% whatever the month's volume, so the part of that which
  the volume rates would not have taken is a rebate, credited on the invoice.
- Small tickets are netted. Accepted outcomes under 20 USD that name their payee accumulate, and settle as one
  release per payee per period: 0.30% of the netted amount, the 0.05 floor once per release, not once per outcome.
  An outcome that names no payee is charged by itself.
- No charge for a duplicate, an infrastructure failure or a retry Knos caused. A rejection that ran correctly is an
  evaluation, and is counted; it is not an outcome, and carries no Acceptance.
- An accepted deliverable is counted once, however many evaluations it took and however often it is listed.
- THE CREDIT RULE, in one sentence: see RULES["credit"].
- A price by the year is billed in twelve parts that add up to the year's price to the cent.
- An annual commitment is sold by the year, billed in twelve parts, and drawn down by use: a month's Meter,
  Acceptance and Record charges come out of what is left of it, and only what it does not cover is charged on
  top. It is never counted twice with usage.
- Connecting a supplier costs nothing, however many are connected.
- The rated party never pays: an invoice is the buyer's, every line of it is addressed to the buyer, and a
  customer-month billed to a supplier is refused.

Arithmetic is `decimal.Decimal`, exact, rounded half up to the cent once per line (Acceptance: once per
deliverable). Nothing here reads the network, the chain or a clock. Nothing has been sold: these are proposed
prices, there is no legal entity to invoice from, and an invoice this module prints is an estimate, not a demand
for payment. On devnet every fee the program takes is test money: 0 revenue.
