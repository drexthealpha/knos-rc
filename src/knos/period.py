"""Each party signs a month of the log: counterpart acknowledgements, and when a month is closed.

A Merkle root, or the head of a chain of hashes, says that the lines under it are the lines that were put there. It
cannot say that both sides saw the same lines, or that one side did not add a line after the other looked. So each
party signs the month itself, with an Ed25519 key the terms name (`window.period_close` of Knos Terms 3):

    acknowledgement   the buyer, or the supplier, signs the month (yyyymm), the last line of the log it read, that
                      line's hash (the head: it commits to every line before it), the month's root (SHA-256 over the
                      hashes of that month's lines up to the last one) and how many there are, the terms' hash and the
                      day. One fact a line, as a transparency log's signed note and its witnesses' cosignatures put it.
    closure           the terms may let one party close a month alone after `silence_days` without an answer: that
                      party signs a closure naming its own acknowledgement, dated that many days or more after it.

A month is CLOSED only by both acknowledgements of the same last line and root, or by a closure the terms allow. After
that, a line missing or changed in the acknowledged range (`missing-after-ack`, `changed-after-ack`) or a counted event
of that month added later (`event-after-close`) is a named discrepancy, found here and by the stand-alone verifier an
evidence archive carries (`acks/`): the rule is written once, in knos.standalone_verify, and read here.

Days are each signer's own word: no clock signs them. Keys are the ones the terms name; who holds a key is the terms'
word too. Money on devnet is test USDC.
