"""How much stands behind an accepted line: four assurance levels, and four words a statement keeps apart.

The levels, lowest first. A line reaches a level only when its own evidence shows it; nothing here is typed by anyone.

    workflow-reported        GitHub (or GitLab) signed a token for the workflow run, and that run reported the result.
                             The signature names which workflow ran where; the result is the run's word.
    re-executed              an evaluator outside the supplier's control ran the pinned suite again and says so by its
                             run's word (receipt levels `rerun` and `agreed`; `knos judge rerun`, the hermetic judge).
    independently-attested   a party other than the buyer and the supplier signed the result. No such party exists
                             today: no line reaches this level, and none may say it does.
    proved                   a proof of the property itself, checked on chain. Only one thing Knos records is proved in
                             this sense: the forge's signature of the workflow identity, which knos_oidc checks in the
                             transaction that pays. An acceptance result is never proved.

So a line's `level` is at most re-executed today, and `identity_proved` says separately whether the chain checked the
signature of the workflow that reported it. The receipt's own levels (knos.receipt.LEVELS: reported, rerun, agreed,
attested) are read, never rewritten: `FROM_RECEIPT` maps them here.

The four words (`words`):

    agreement        both sides reconstruct the same lines from the recorded events
    completeness     the record has no gap: what the sequence and acknowledgement checks cover, and what nothing checks
    correctness      the acceptance decision matches the terms: the level each line reached says how it was checked
    satisfaction     the buyer got what it wanted commercially: never claimed by Knos, by any level

`knos assurance FILE` prints the levels of a receipt, or of every line of a statement, and the four words."""
