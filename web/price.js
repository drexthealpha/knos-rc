//   on chain  what knos_pay takes at release, in millionths of a whole unit of the mint (USDC has six decimals), as
//             the program holds it. priceConstants() takes each constant from what sdk/settle exports (settle.js in
//             the built site) and, for the ones the exported client does not have, from RECORDED below. The three
//             METER_* values are knos_meter's own on devnet: that program is unchanged, the price book's Meter is
//             charged from prepaid credits, and its numbers are BILL's.
// tests/data/billing_vectors.json holds every row and number; this file and the Python are both tested against it.
//
// THE FEE FOLLOWS THE BUILD THAT IS LIVE. knos_pay has two fee rules (settle.js v2.FEE_RULES):
//   0.3.18 (knos_pay 2.2)  0.30% of the amount, at least 0.05; one rate, no tiers; a Plan no lower than 0.10%
//   0.3.14 (knos_pay 2.1)  three tiers: 2.5% up to 1,000, 1% to 50,000, 0.5% above, at least 0.40
// The public programs charge the 0.3.14 fee until the upgrade to 2.2 executes. priceConstants(lib, version) gives the
// constants of the rule the program of `version` applies (web/version.js asks the program; web/fee_live.js asks it
// and, when devnet does not answer, reads upgrades.json); with no version it gives this tree's own, the 0.3.18 one.
// The funder pays the fee on top of the amount. Orders funded before the upgrade keep the rate fixed at their funding.
