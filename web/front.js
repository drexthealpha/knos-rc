# issue, and the pull request that closes it is paid when it is merged. It needs no secret, and nothing in this
# repository holds a key or money.
#
# What starts it, and what it then does:
#
#   A new comment (\`issue_comment\`).
#       A comment with a line that starts with /knos is a command; any other comment starts no job. The command job
#       runs it and always answers with a comment. \`/knos fund 20\` on an issue puts 20 test USDC in escrow for it;
#       \`/knos help\` lists the rest. Commands are read on issues and on pull requests, from anyone who can comment.
#       Who may give which command is decided by the command itself and, where money moves, by the escrow on
#       Solana, which goes by GitHub's own signature of who commented.
#   A new issue (\`issues\`).
#       An issue whose description has a line \`/knos fund <amount>\` is funded as it is opened.
#   A push (\`push\`).
#       Merging a pull request pushes to the default branch. The settle job finds the pull requests that push merged.
#       For each one that closes a funded issue it checks the bounty's terms at the merged commit (the checks the
#       funder named must have passed there) and, only if they hold, asks GitHub for a signed statement that pays
#       the pull request's author. Pushes to other branches, and tags, start no job.
#       GitHub runs this file as it is at the pushed commit. A push made with a workflow's own token starts no run
#       (GitHub's rule), and a commit message with [skip ci] starts none either. For those, \`/knos settle\` on the
#       merged pull request does the same work.
#   A run started by hand (\`workflow_dispatch\`).
#       Actions > knos > Run workflow, with a merged pull request's number: tries its payment again.
#   The check has finished (\`workflow_run\`).
#       Only with the second, optional file, knos-check.yml (the check on every pull request). When that check ends,
#       GitHub runs this file's copy on the default branch, never the pull request's. The review job repeats the
#       check and, from here, may say the result in one comment on the pull request and remember what it learned
#       (in an issue labelled knos-memory). For an issue funded with acceptance checks (.knos/acceptance/<issue>/)
#       a job that cannot ask for a signed statement runs them against the pull request in a sandbox; only if they
#       pass does another job, which runs none of the pull request's code, ask for the statement that pays.
#       A first-time contributor's check waits for a maintainer's approval, and nothing here runs before it.
#
# What it can do in this repository: read the code, the checks and the workflow runs; write on issues and pull
# requests (it comments, assigns an issue to the person who takes it, and keeps its notes in an issue labelled
# knos-memory); ask GitHub for signed statements about what happened here (id-token). What it cannot do: change
# code, branches, tags, releases or settings. It has no write access to the repository's contents.
#
# Why it is safe to install. It does not use \`pull_request_target\`. No job that can ask for a signed statement
# checks out or runs anything from a pull request, or anything else from this repository: those jobs install Knos
# and read GitHub's own records. The one job that runs a pull request's code (the acceptance checks, in a sandbox)
# has a token that can only read this repository's contents, no secret, and no way to ask for a signed statement.
#
# No secret is needed. The signed statements are posted as comments, and Knos's public relay carries them to Solana
# and pays the transaction fees. They are public on purpose: each names one action and the escrow takes it once.
# Optional: with a repository secret KNOS_RELAY_KEY (a Solana key that holds a little SOL for fees, never a bounty's
# money) the jobs carry their own statements and do not wait for the relay.
#
# The Knos workflows are named by a full commit. The escrow records that commit when a bounty is funded and takes
# the pay token only from the same commit. They accept no inputs, so this file cannot change what they do:
# editing the conditions below only changes when they run. Keep the three names that start with "knos": by them
# Knos tells its own jobs from the checks a bounty can require.

#
# What starts it, and what it then does:
#
#   A pull request is opened, gets new commits, is reopened, or its title or description is edited (\`pull_request\`).
#       When the description says the tests pass or CI is green, Knos compares that with GitHub's own record of the
#       head commit and fails the status "check / claims" when a check failed. It also applies this repository's
#       CONTRIBUTING rules, and for a pull request that closes a funded issue it says what the payment still needs.
#       It runs none of the pull request's code. The result is the status and the job's summary.
#
# What it can do in this repository: read the code, the pull request, the issue it closes, and the checks and
# workflow runs of its commit. What it cannot do: write anything. Every permission below is read. For a pull
# request from a fork GitHub gives the run a token that can only read, no secret and no id-token whatever a file asks.
#
# How GitHub runs it:
#   - The first run for a first-time contributor's pull request waits until a maintainer approves it, on the pull
#     request's page.
#   - GitHub runs this file as the pull request has it, so a pull request can change the file for its own run. That
#     is why this check is advice and nothing about money depends on it: knos.yml checks again at the merge, from
#     the default branch.
#   - Keep the name "knos check". knos.yml waits for a workflow of that name, to repeat the check where it may
#     comment on the pull request.
#
# To require the check before a merge: Settings > Rules > New branch ruleset > Require status checks > add
# "check / claims".
