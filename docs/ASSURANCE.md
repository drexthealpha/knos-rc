# Assurance

No outside party has audited these programs. All money on them today is test money on Solana devnet. Before any real money: an outside review, then a deployment under different program ids.

This page is about the second deployment, [`programs-v2`](../programs-v2): `knos_oidc` verifies GitHub's signed token on chain, and `knos_pay` holds and pays the money. That deployment can still be changed, only through a multisig and only after a public 48-hour delay. Today every key of that multisig is the founder's. The first deployment (`programs`) is not covered here: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), section 8, says how it differs. SECURITY.md also says who is trusted for what and lists every known limit. This page says which tests hold the code to which rule, how to run them, and where a reviewer should look first.

## Invariants and the tests that enforce them

A test is evidence, not proof. Read the tables with three facts in mind.

- The tests were written by the people who wrote the code.
- The chain tests run the compiled programs in LiteSVM, a simulator that runs in the test process. They load test builds (`--features testkeys`), which also trust seed-derived test keys. Where a row says "real build", the test loads `knos_oidc_v2_real.so`, which is built with no features.
- The off-chain tests replace GitHub with fakes (`tests/_hub.py`), and the suite refuses every non-loopback connection.

A test with a case count in brackets runs once per case. A Rust test is named by its file and its module.

### The verifier (`knos_oidc`)

| Invariant | Test |
|---|---|
| A token whose claims or signature were changed after signing, that another key signed, that says `alg` `none` or `HS256`, or that names a look-alike issuer, is refused. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_every_forgery_is_refused` (16 named forgeries, signatures at or above the modulus, signatures 0 and 1) |
| On random tokens, each also with one random bit flipped, the verifier gives the same verdict as OpenSSL (60 tokens, 120 verdicts, fixed seed). | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_the_chain_agrees_with_a_reference_rsa_library_on_random_tokens` |
| The RSA arithmetic passes Project Wycheproof's RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 SHA-256 vectors. 2048-bit file: 7 valid accepted, 249 invalid refused, 1 "acceptable" refused, 2 skipped (exponent not 65537). 4096-bit file: 7, 250, 1, none skipped. | `programs-v2/knos_oidc/tests/wycheproof.rs::wycheproof_rsa_2048_sha256`, `::wycheproof_rsa_4096_sha256` (run by `cargo test`, not by pytest) |
| A claim is read as the signer wrote it: escaped text reads the same, and a repeated, missing or wrongly typed claim is refused. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_escaped_claims_read_as_the_same_text`; the `iss twice`, `exp as a string` and `no exp` cases of `test_every_forgery_is_refused` |
| Only GitHub's four keys of 2 Oct 2026 are accepted without an attestation. GitLab's keys and every other key need one. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_a_genesis_key_verifies_at_once_and_only_githubs_four_keys_are_genesis` |
| Real build: none of the test keys is trusted, and the test guardian has no power. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_the_real_build_trusts_none_of_the_test_values` |
| An attestation admits or refreshes a key only if every condition holds: the pinned workflow file and commit, the pinned account and its two repositories, a scheduled or by-hand run, a GitHub-hosted runner, the right audience, not stale. Each is broken in turn (18 wrong claims, each tried for both). | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_every_condition_of_the_attestation_is_needed_to_register_a_key_and_to_refresh_one` |
| An attested key verifies nothing for a day, and nothing until the guardian approves it. Neither alone admits it. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_an_attested_key_verifies_only_after_its_delay_and_the_guardians_approval` |
| A key expires 30 days after it was last attested, and a refresh never moves the expiry earlier. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_a_key_past_its_expiry_verifies_nothing_until_github_names_it_again`, `::test_refresh_moves_the_expiry_to_thirty_days_from_now_and_never_earlier` |
| A revoked key signs nothing, for ever. The guardian can approve and revoke, and can do nothing else. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_revoke_is_for_ever`, `::test_only_the_guardian_approves_and_revokes_and_it_can_do_nothing_else` |
| Only the payer of a token account can step or close it, a verified account is final, and a verification begun under one key cannot be finished under another. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_a_token_account_belongs_to_its_payer_and_closes_with_its_rent` |
| A key whose Montgomery constants are wrong is refused. | `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py::test_wrong_montgomery_constants_are_refused` |
| A key is usable only when approved or genesis, active, unexpired and not revoked. A key account never reads as a verified token. | `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/lib.rs`: `tests::a_key_is_usable_only_when_approved_or_genesis_active_unexpired_and_not_revoked`, `tests::a_key_header_can_never_read_as_a_verified_token` |

### The payment program (`knos_pay`)

| Invariant | Test |
|---|---|
| A job pays at most once. It is closed in the instruction that pays it, so a second proof finds no job, and a proof after the deadline pays nothing. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_proof_pays_nothing_after_the_deadline_and_no_job_twice` |
| **Random walk.** After every step, the vault of each mint holds exactly what its open and held jobs are owed. At the end, funded equals paid plus fees plus refunded. The walk mixes funding, paying, settling, refunding, binding, withdrawing, time and deliberately bad proofs, in an SPL Token mint and in a Token-2022 mint with a permanent delegate and the other extensions the regulated stablecoins carry. Default: 600 steps. CI: 10,000 steps per deployment, as four walks of 2,500, each from its own seed. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_random_walk_keeps_every_vault_equal_to_its_open_jobs` |
| Only the funder's balance is debited. A fund token spends only the balance it names, and only once. Only the owner and the spenders it lists can spend it. A comment in another owner's repository spends nothing. The cap per job holds. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_fund_token_spends_only_the_balance_it_names`, `::test_a_fund_token_works_once`, `::test_only_the_owner_and_the_listed_spenders_spend_a_balance`, `::test_a_comment_in_another_owners_repository_cannot_spend_a_balance`, `::test_a_cap_per_job_is_enforced` |
| A funding that breaks a bound, names the wrong accounts or carries the wrong token moves nothing. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_comment_does_not_fund_with` (32 cases), `::test_a_wallet_does_not_fund_with` (15 cases) |
| A payment goes only to the right accounts, from the right workflow at the right commit, under the job's own terms hash. A wrong fee account, a wrong destination and another terms hash are among the cases that pay nothing, and the real proof still pays afterwards. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_job_is_not_paid_with` (38 cases) |
| A proof pays only jobs that pin the same workflow and terms. A stranger's job on the same issue, pinned to another workflow, is not paid. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_one_proof_pays_every_job_on_the_issue_that_pins_the_same_workflow_and_terms` |
| A held payment goes only to the wallet its GitHub user bound: not to an address inside a token, not to a wallet someone else bound, not to a relayer's choice. No other proof can take it while it is held. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_proof_pays_the_payees_bound_wallet_whatever_address_the_token_carries`, `::test_with_no_wallet_the_job_is_held_for_the_payee_and_paid_once_they_bind_one` |
| A held payment goes back to the funder after 180 days, and not before. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_held_job_returns_to_the_funder_after_180_days_and_not_before` |
| Only the owner of a GitHub account can bind a wallet to it, by hand, from that account's own `knos-claim` repository. Twenty other ways are refused. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_github_user_binds_a_wallet_from_their_own_knos_claim_repository`, `::test_a_wallet_is_not_bound_with` (20 cases), `::test_nobody_binds_a_wallet_for_someone_else` |
| With no proof by the deadline, the money goes back where it came from, with no token, and only to that account. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_with_no_proof_by_the_deadline_the_money_goes_back_where_it_came_from` |
| Unspent balance money goes back only to the wallet that opened the balance, and only that wallet changes its cap and spenders. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_unspent_money_goes_back_only_to_the_wallet_that_opened_the_balance`, `::test_only_the_wallet_that_opened_a_balance_changes_its_cap_and_spenders` |
| A revoked key signs nothing that pays. From the revocation on, every instruction that takes a token refuses it, tokens verified earlier included. An expired key does the same until it is attested again. Refunds, withdrawals and settling a held payment go on. A token is taken only with the key account it names. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_token_is_refused_once_its_key_is_revoked`, `::test_a_token_is_refused_while_its_key_is_expired_and_works_again_once_the_key_is_refreshed`, `::test_a_token_is_taken_only_with_the_key_account_it_names` |
| The guardian can pause new funding and nothing else. Payments, refunds, withdrawals and bindings ignore a pause. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_the_guardian_pauses_new_funding_only_and_nobody_else_can` |
| No money enters a Token-2022 mint that is non-transferable, starts accounts frozen, has a transfer hook program or has a transfer fee, now or scheduled (7 cases). Money already in escrow still leaves when a mint turns bad. The mints are made with Token-2022's own instructions. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_no_money_enters_in_a_mint_that_is` (7 cases), `::test_a_mint_that_turns_bad_takes_no_new_money_and_money_in_escrow_still_leaves`, `::test_a_mint_is_a_mint_of_the_token_program_passed_and_harmless_extensions_are_accepted`; `programs-v2/knos_pay/src/token.rs`: `tests::the_extensions_that_could_block_or_tax_a_payout_are_refused_and_no_other` |
| A mint's issuer keeps its powers, and the books say so: tokens sent straight to a vault belong to no job, and tokens a permanent delegate takes out leave the job waiting, unpaid, until they are back. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_tokens_sent_to_a_vault_directly_belong_to_no_job_and_stay_there`, `::test_a_mints_issuer_keeps_its_powers_over_the_vault_and_the_job_waits` |
| The faucet exists once, and only in the devnet build. A token that names another balance mints nothing. | `tests/test_pay2_chain.py::test_the_faucet_exists_once_and_the_real_money_build_has_none`, `::test_the_faucet_mints_nothing_for_a_token_that_names_another_balance` |
| The fee is 2.5%, at least 0.05 USDC, and never more than the amount. | `programs-v2/knos_pay/src/lib.rs`: `tests::the_fee_is_two_and_a_half_percent_with_a_floor_and_never_more_than_the_amount` |

### The off-chain flow

This is the code that decides, before anything is signed, whether a merge earns a payment and who gets it. The chain does not check these decisions.

| Invariant | Test |
|---|---|
| **Random terms.** Equal terms are the same bytes, and a hash names one set of terms. Of 300 random terms, each with 12 damaged copies (seed 600), every copy is either refused or is exactly the bytes of the terms it reads as. | `tests/test_terms.py::test_equal_terms_are_the_same_bytes_and_the_hash_is_their_sha256`, `::test_no_bytes_but_the_canonical_ones_are_ever_read` |
| A required check is in exactly one of six states. Only every check passed, with every changed file in scope, is acceptance. Each state has its own outcome in the reply. | `tests/test_terms.py::test_a_required_check_is_in_exactly_one_of_six_states`, `::test_only_every_check_passed_and_nothing_out_of_scope_is_acceptance`; `tests/test_flow.py::test_each_state_of_a_required_check_has_its_own_outcome` (6 cases) |
| A check of the same name from another app is not the check. Knos's own jobs are never evidence. A description cannot change what is required. | `tests/test_terms.py::test_only_the_app_the_terms_name_can_produce_the_check`, `::test_knos_own_jobs_are_never_evidence`, `::test_a_description_cannot_change_what_is_required` |
| A person's pull request pays that person, whatever it says. A bot's pays nobody until GitHub authenticates a person. | `tests/test_who.py::test_a_persons_pull_request_pays_that_person_whatever_it_says`, `::test_a_bots_pull_request_pays_nobody_until_github_authenticates_a_person`, `::test_the_three_ways_are_tried_in_order` |
| Prose never decides. A description is a hint. An edited comment does not count. A maintainer is whoever GitHub says can write now. | `tests/test_who.py::test_a_description_is_a_hint_to_show_and_never_decides`, `::test_a_comment_counts_only_as_it_was_first_written`, `::test_a_maintainer_is_whoever_github_says_can_write_now` |
| An assigned issue pays only its assignee's pull request. A maintainer's `/knos reject` before the merge means nobody is paid. | `tests/test_who.py::test_an_assigned_issue_pays_only_its_assignees_pull_request`, `::test_a_maintainers_reject_before_the_merge_means_nobody_is_paid`; `tests/test_flow.py::test_a_pull_request_a_maintainer_rejected_before_the_merge_is_not_paid` |
| Nothing is decided on half an answer. Where GitHub did not answer, nobody is paid until `/knos settle` runs again. | `tests/test_who.py::test_at_the_merge_what_github_did_not_answer_pays_nobody_yet`, `::test_at_the_merge_a_bots_pull_request_is_not_decided_on_half_an_answer` |
| The pull request must close the issue. A description edited after the merge closes nothing. A pull request merged before the bounty was funded does not take it. | `tests/test_closing.py::test_githubs_documented_keywords_close_an_issue`, `::test_what_is_not_a_closing_keyword_closes_nothing`, `::test_a_description_edited_at_or_after_the_merge_is_told_from_one_edited_before_it`; `tests/test_who.py::test_at_the_merge_the_pull_request_must_close_the_issue_it_is_paid_for`, `::test_a_description_edited_after_the_merge_closes_nothing_where_money_moves`; `tests/test_flow.py::test_a_pull_request_merged_before_the_bounty_was_funded_does_not_take_it`, `::test_a_description_edited_after_the_merge_takes_no_bounty` |
| Where the money goes: the bound wallet, else the payee's own unedited address comment, else it is held. | `tests/test_who.py::test_the_payout_address_is_the_bound_wallet_else_the_payees_own_unedited_comment`; `tests/test_flow.py::test_where_the_money_goes_a_bound_wallet_else_the_authors_address_else_it_is_held` |
| The gate holds a bounty's pull request to the terms and to who is paid. A claim on a commit with no check runs is refused. | `tests/test_gate.py::test_the_gate_holds_a_bountys_pull_request_to_the_terms_and_to_who_is_paid`, `::test_a_claim_on_a_commit_with_no_check_runs_is_refused_at_the_merge` |
| Only a person GitHub says can write funds from a comment, and a balance in a made-up token is never spent by a comment. | `tests/test_flow.py::test_only_someone_with_write_access_may_fund`, `::test_a_strangers_balance_in_a_token_of_their_own_is_never_spent_by_a_comment` |
| Only what a push to the default branch merged is settled. In tests mode, the job after the judge signs nothing it has not read again itself. | `tests/test_flow.py::test_only_what_a_push_to_the_default_branch_merged_is_settled`, `::test_the_job_after_the_judge_signs_nothing_it_has_not_read_again_itself` |
| A relayer refuses what the chain would refuse before it spends a fee, and a token carried twice or by two relayers is done once. | `tests/test_relay2.py::test_a_fund_token_costs_nothing_with` (27 cases), `::test_a_proof_costs_nothing_with` (13), `::test_a_claim_costs_nothing_with` (12), `::test_a_token_relayed_twice_or_by_two_relayers_is_done_once` |
| A job's terms are the ones its hash names, whatever else was logged at its address. | `tests/test_relay2.py::test_a_jobs_terms_are_the_ones_its_hash_names_whatever_else_was_logged_at_its_address` |

### The workflows

| Invariant | Test |
|---|---|
| No job that runs pull request code can mint a token. The job that runs it can only read, hands nothing on, and has no secret. The job that signs checks nothing out and runs no git. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_a_token_is_asked_for_only_by_jobs_that_run_no_pull_request_code_and_check_nothing_out`, `::test_the_job_that_runs_pull_request_code_can_only_read_and_hands_nothing_on` |
| No workflow is started by `pull_request_target`. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_every_workflow_parses_and_none_is_started_by_pull_request_target` |
| No caller can change which code judges: no inputs, one exact release of `knos`, dependencies no newer than one date. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_no_caller_can_change_which_code_judges`, `::test_the_release_the_workflows_install_is_this_one_and_its_cutoff_comes_after_it` |
| Every action is a full commit from the pin list, and every called workflow is a pinned commit. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_every_action_is_a_commit_listed_in_action_pins_and_every_called_workflow_is_a_pinned_one` |
| Permissions start empty and each job gets the least. Nothing of Knos's can write to code, releases or settings. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_permissions_start_empty_and_each_job_gets_the_least` |
| Text a person wrote never reaches a shell except through the event file or an environment variable. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_untrusted_text_reaches_a_shell_only_through_the_event_file_or_env` |
| The only secret is the optional relay key, and only a step that can mint gets it. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_the_only_secret_is_the_optional_relay_key_and_only_a_step_that_can_mint_gets_it` |
| No job of the payment flow restores or saves a cache, and no job that signs or sees a secret uses one. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_no_job_of_the_payment_flow_restores_or_saves_a_cache`, `::test_no_job_that_signs_or_sees_a_secret_uses_a_cache` |
| A wallet is bound by hand only: the claim file names the pinned commit and takes the address from the one input. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_the_claim_caller_names_the_pinned_commit_and_takes_the_address_from_the_right_place` |
| The called workflows refuse, by their own conditions, an edited comment and a push that is not to the default branch. | `tests/test_workflows2.py::test_the_called_workflows_refuse_by_themselves_what_no_caller_should_send` |

## What was read as an attacker

Both programs were read line by line against the attacks below before this release. This is the author's own review, not an outside audit.

In this part `T` is `tests/test_oidc2_chain.py`.

### The verifier: reviewed and found sound

RSA

- Signature equal to or above the modulus: refused before any arithmetic (`rsa::geq`, error 65). `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`
- Signature shorter or longer than the modulus, padded base64, a 2048-bit signature under a 4096-bit key and the reverse: the decoded length must be exactly `4 * limbs` (65). `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`
- Signature 0 or 1: the result is not the encoding (70). `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`
- Lenient PKCS#1 v1.5 parsing (short padding, wrong DigestInfo, missing NULL, bytes after the digest): `pkcs1_sha256_ok` compares every byte of `00 01 FF.. 00 DigestInfo digest` over the whole modulus length, so there is nothing to parse. `programs-v2/knos_oidc/tests/wycheproof.rs::wycheproof_rsa_2048_sha256`, `::wycheproof_rsa_4096_sha256`; `T::test_the_chain_agrees_with_a_reference_rsa_library_on_random_tokens`
- Another exponent: none is stored or sent; Step always does 16 squarings and one multiplication (65537). A key registered with another exponent only fails to verify. Same Wycheproof tests.
- A key used before its Montgomery constants are checked: `load_key` needs state 1 (68); KeyParams checks `n0inv * n[0] == -1` and `r2 == R^2 mod n` on chain and runs once (66, 69). `T::test_wrong_montgomery_constants_are_refused`, `T::test_nothing_computed_for_one_token_serves_another_and_no_account_stands_in_for_another`
- An even modulus, or one with its top bit clear (a short modulus padded to 256 or 512 bytes, which would give a second hash for the same key): refused at RegisterKey (66). `T::test_wrong_montgomery_constants_are_refused`
- A step plan that does not match the key: the program counts the squarings itself (`T_DONE`, never above 16), so any split gives s^65537 or runs out of compute and leaves nothing behind. `T::test_the_plans_fit_the_longest_token_the_program_takes`, `T::test_a_token_account_belongs_to_its_payer_and_closes_with_its_rent`, `T::test_nothing_computed_for_one_token_serves_another_and_no_account_stands_in_for_another`
- The half-done power of one token used for another: Write refuses once the first Step has run (69), and closing zeroes the account. `T::test_nothing_computed_for_one_token_serves_another_and_no_account_stands_in_for_another`
- A verification begun under one key and finished under another: the key's address is stored at the first Step and compared at every later one (68); a key's modulus never changes and a key account is never closed. `T::test_a_token_account_belongs_to_its_payer_and_closes_with_its_rent`
- Someone else's token account stepped, resumed or closed: its address is derived from the signer and the id (67). `T::test_a_token_account_belongs_to_its_payer_and_closes_with_its_rent`
- A verified account changed afterwards: Write and Step refuse it (69). `T::test_a_token_account_belongs_to_its_payer_and_closes_with_its_rent`

Token and claims

- `alg` none or HS256, `alg` twice: refused (71, 62). `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`, `T::test_claims_are_read_at_the_top_level_only_and_a_time_is_plain_digits`
- Another issuer's key vouching for `iss`, a look-alike `iss`, `iss` twice: `iss` must be the text of the key's own issuer, and a wanted claim written twice is refused (72, 62). `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`, `T::test_a_gitlab_token_under_a_4096_bit_key_is_verified_in_six`
- A claim's name inside a nested object, a list or a string's text: only top-level keys are read; strings are skipped with their escapes. `T::test_claims_are_read_at_the_top_level_only_and_a_time_is_plain_digits`
- A claim RegisterKey reads written twice (first value harmless, second not, or the reverse): refused (62). Same test.
- Escaped characters to make two spellings differ: `\/ \\ \" \u00XX` (printable ASCII) are decoded before comparing, every other escape is refused (63). `T::test_escaped_claims_read_as_the_same_text`
- `exp` as text, with a sign, an exponent, a fraction, a leading zero, 19 digits, a list, an object, or twice: refused (63, 62). `T::test_claims_are_read_at_the_top_level_only_and_a_time_is_plain_digits`, `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`
- Ids that only start like the right one, or are not numbers: `parse_u64` takes digits only and compares the whole value (74, 63). `T::test_every_condition_of_the_attestation_is_needed_to_register_a_key_and_to_refresh_one`
- Bytes after the payload object, a payload that is not an object, a fourth part: refused (61); a part that is not base64url changes the signed bytes (70), and `claims.rs` refuses stray trailing bits (60, read, no test on chain). `T::test_every_forgery_is_refused`
- Very long tokens and values: at most 8,192 bytes, checked before anything is written (64); the longest and the costliest shapes still verify inside the compute limit. `T::test_the_plans_fit_the_longest_token_the_program_takes`

The attestation that registers or refreshes a key

- Another repository, another owner, an owner and a repository that do not belong together, another event, another workflow file, the same file name in another repository, another commit, a self-hosted runner, an audience naming another issuer, another key, capitals, or another action; a missing claim; a claim of the wrong type: each refused (74, 63). `T::test_every_condition_of_the_attestation_is_needed_to_register_a_key_and_to_refresh_one`
- An attestation signed by GitLab's key with the same claims: the verifying key's issuer must be GitHub (74). Same test.
- An account that is not a verified token (one still being written, a key account, a wallet, nothing): refused (73); a key account's first byte is never 2. Same test; `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/lib.rs::tests::a_key_header_can_never_read_as_a_verified_token`
- Replay of an old attestation: refused an hour after its `exp` (75); inside that hour RegisterKey works once per key (the account exists afterwards, 67) and Refresh only sets `max(expires_at, now + KEY_TTL)`. Same test; `T::test_refresh_moves_the_expiry_to_thirty_days_from_now_and_never_earlier`
- An attestation signed by a key that is revoked, expired, not approved or still waiting: Step refuses to verify it (78, 77, 76), on every call, so a verification begun earlier stops too. `T::test_revoke_is_for_ever`, `T::test_a_key_past_its_expiry_verifies_nothing_until_github_names_it_again`, `T::test_an_attested_key_verifies_only_after_its_delay_and_the_guardians_approval`. (One verified before the key stopped: see the defect below.)

- Using an attested key early: it needs the day and the guardian's approval, both (76); the program is stricter than "a day unless the guardian approves sooner". `T::test_an_attested_key_verifies_only_after_its_delay_and_the_guardians_approval`
- A key past its expiry, a second registration to get a new life, the guardian approving an expired key: refused (77, 67, 77). `T::test_a_key_past_its_expiry_verifies_nothing_until_github_names_it_again`
- Refresh to shorten a wait, approve, or move an expiry earlier: it writes `expires_at` only, never earlier. `T::test_refresh_moves_the_expiry_to_thirty_days_from_now_and_never_earlier`
- Approve or Revoke by anyone else, by the guardian's address without its signature, with extra data, or on an account that is not a key: refused (79, 68). `T::test_only_the_guardian_approves_and_revokes_and_it_can_do_nothing_else`
- Undoing a revocation by Approve, Refresh, RegisterKey, KeyParams or time: refused (78, 78, 67, 69); the account stays, so the hash cannot be registered again. `T::test_revoke_is_for_ever`
- Genesis: only GitHub's four hashes, each under issuer 0 only; the same modulus under GitLab's issuer, GitLab's own keys and any other key need an attestation (73). `T::test_a_genesis_key_verifies_at_once_and_only_githubs_four_keys_are_genesis`
- The test keys, test rotate pin, test repository and test guardian in the real build: absent. `T::test_the_real_build_trusts_none_of_the_test_values`, `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/lib.rs::tests::the_attester_is_the_pinned_account_and_its_two_repositories`

Accounts

- Write to an address not derived from the payer and the id, or with another program in the system program's place; RegisterKey to an address not derived from the issuer and the modulus's hash; a payer that did not sign in Write, Step, Close, RegisterKey, KeyParams, Refresh: refused (67). `T::test_nothing_computed_for_one_token_serves_another_and_no_account_stands_in_for_another`, `T::test_refresh_moves_the_expiry_to_thirty_days_from_now_and_never_earlier`
- A token account, a wallet or another program's account in a key's place (Step, KeyParams, Refresh, Approve, Revoke), and a key account in a token's place: a token's third byte is at most 16 where a key's is 64 or 128, and the lengths are checked (68; KeyParams answers with invalid instruction data). `T::test_nothing_computed_for_one_token_serves_another_and_no_account_stands_in_for_another`, `T::test_wrong_montgomery_constants_are_refused`, `T::test_only_the_guardian_approves_and_revokes_and_it_can_do_nothing_else`
- Writable flags: every account the program writes is written through the runtime's own check; no instruction trusts a flag it does not test.

Clock

- A token past its `exp` still verifies (Step asks nothing about lateness, by design); every use of it here asks `fresh` (an hour past `exp`, 75). `T::test_every_condition_of_the_attestation_is_needed_to_register_a_key_and_to_refresh_one`, `T::test_no_token_outlives_its_key_by_more_than_25_hours_whatever_expiry_it_carries`
- `iat` and `nbf` are not read here: nothing in this program orders tokens by them.

### The verifier: defects found and fixed

- A revocation (or an expiry) did not end what the key had already verified. `exp` is whatever the key's holder signs, Step accepted any `exp`, and RegisterKey and Refresh ask only whether the attestation is within an hour of its `exp`. So the holder of a leaked GitHub key could verify one attestation with an expiry years away before the guardian revoked the key, and use it afterwards for as long as he liked: measured on the old build, Refresh of another key 29 and 58 days after the revocation, and RegisterKey of his own key 58 days after it (that key still needs the guardian's approval). Fix: the finishing Step refuses `exp > now + AHEAD` (86,400 s, error 63), so no token account passes `fresh` more than AHEAD + LATE (25 hours) after its key was last usable. No instruction's bytes or accounts changed; fixtures rebuilt and pinned. `T::test_no_token_outlives_its_key_by_more_than_25_hours_whatever_expiry_it_carries`, `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/lib.rs::tests::a_token_verified_while_its_key_was_usable_is_fresh_for_at_most_25_hours_more`

### The verifier: left open (not changed)

- The 25 hours above. Inside them a token verified under a key that has since stopped can still refresh a key GitHub really publishes (which changes nothing an attacker gains from) or register a new key, and a new key verifies nothing until the guardian approves it. To make the window zero, RegisterKey and Refresh would take the key account the attestation names and ask `key_usable`, as knos-pay does for its tokens; that adds an account to both instructions and is planned for the build that goes to outside review.
- `idl/knos_oidc_v2.json` was not edited (no bytes or accounts changed): its text for Step and for error 63 does not mention the bound on `exp`.
- A token from a job whose `exp` is more than a day ahead (possible only for an issuer that lets a token live that long) is refused until the bound is met; GitHub's tokens are far inside it.
- A genesis hash that nobody registered can be registered at any later time with a full KEY_TTL and no attestation, and the guardian cannot revoke a key that has no account. `pins.rs` says to register all four at deployment; if one is ever left out, the guardian has to register and revoke it itself.

### The payment program: reviewed and found sound

Tests named in this part are in `tests/test_pay2_chain.py` unless a Rust file is given.

Account substitution
- A forged job, another user's bind, record or pair, another mint, its vault, the other token program, a wrong `auth`, a wrong `rent_to` in Pay: every account is re-derived from the job's own fields or the token's payee, and a job is read only at the address its fields derive. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_job_is_not_paid_with` (38 cases).
- The same in FundBalance (baltok, mint, vault, auth, token program, pause, job, a non-Balance as the Balance): `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_comment_does_not_fund_with`; in FundWallet: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_wallet_does_not_fund_with`.
- Refund to a thief, to another Balance, to the wallet that opened the Balance, with a wrong vault, auth, rent account, mint or token program: a Balance's job goes only to that Balance's token account, a wallet's job only to a token account of that wallet. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_with_no_proof_by_the_deadline_the_money_goes_back_where_it_came_from`.
- Withdraw or SetBalance by anyone but the wallet that opened the Balance, or to a token account that wallet does not own: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_unspent_money_goes_back_only_to_the_wallet_that_opened_the_balance`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_only_the_wallet_that_opened_a_balance_changes_its_cap_and_spenders`.
- One kind of account read as another (a Balance as a job, a key account as a token): lengths differ, each is read at its own PDA, and a verifier key account never has the VERIFIED stage byte. `state.rs::layouts_do_not_overlap_and_fill_their_lengths`, case "a token account of the verifier's in place of the key" of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`.
- A token program that is neither SPL Token nor Token-2022, or not the mint's owner: `mint_of` runs before every CPI to it. `token.rs::a_mint_is_a_mint_of_the_token_program_passed`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_mint_is_a_mint_of_the_token_program_passed_and_harmless_extensions_are_accepted`.
- A missing signature (relayer, authority, guardian): cases in `test_a_proof_pays_nothing_after_the_deadline_and_no_job_twice`, `test_an_issue_has_one_job_per_balance_and_a_relayer_must_sign`, `test_the_guardian_pauses_new_funding_only_and_nobody_else_can`.

Replay of a signed token
- A fund token twice, or out of order: `iat` must be later than the Balance's last. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_fund_token_works_once`.
- A fund token against another Balance (so another mint or another wallet's money): the audience names one Balance by address. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_fund_token_spends_only_the_balance_it_names`, `gh.rs::a_fund_audience_names_one_balance_as_solana_prints_it`.
- A comment in a repository another account owns, or by someone who is not the owner or a listed spender: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_comment_in_another_owners_repository_cannot_spend_a_balance`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_only_the_owner_and_the_listed_spenders_spend_a_balance`.
- A pay token against another repository, another issue, other terms, the other mode, another workflow repository or commit: cases of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`.
- A pay token against a job funded after it was issued (a job re-created at the same address after a payment or refund included): `not_before`. Case "a token issued before the funding" of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`.
- One pay token paying several jobs on the same issue: it does, when they pin the same workflow and terms. This is the documented design, and each job pays the payee the proof names. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_one_proof_pays_every_job_on_the_issue_that_pins_the_same_workflow_and_terms`.
- A first-deployment token (`knos:` audience) or one kind of audience used as another: every parser requires `knos2` and its own word, with an exact number of fields. Cases "a first-deployment audience", "a pay audience", "a bind audience", "a first-deployment claim audience" of the three refusal tests.
- A bind token twice or an older one after a newer: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_wallet_is_not_bound_with` (case "an older token than the bind's"), `test_pay2_chain.py::test_nobody_binds_a_wallet_for_someone_else`.
- A GitLab token, an unverified token, a verified token's bytes in an account the verifier does not own: cases of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`.

Time bounds and the verifier's key
- `iat` more than 300 seconds ahead, `exp` more than an hour after `iat`, a token more than an hour past expiry: cases "a token from the future", "a token that claims to live for hours", "an expired token" of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`. Claim numbers have at most 18 digits, so the casts to i64 cannot wrap.
- `run_attempt` other than 1 for funding and binding: cases "a re-run of the commenter's run" (`test_a_comment_does_not_fund_with`) and "a re-run of the owner's run", "a re-run of the first push" (`test_a_wallet_is_not_bound_with`). A re-run of a proof is accepted on purpose.
- A token whose key was revoked or has expired, or passed with another key account: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_token_is_refused_once_its_key_is_revoked`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_token_is_refused_while_its_key_is_expired_and_works_again_once_the_key_is_refreshed`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_token_is_taken_only_with_the_key_account_it_names`.

Arithmetic
- Fee, cap and amount: `fee_of` cannot overflow and never exceeds the amount; amounts are bounded 1_000_000..=500_000_000 units; the record's counters saturate. `lib.rs::the_fee_is_two_and_a_half_percent_with_a_floor_and_never_more_than_the_amount`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_cap_per_job_is_enforced`, cases "less than the smallest bounty", "more than the largest bounty" of the two funding refusal tests.
- A job credited with more than its vault received: the job stores the vault's balance after the transfer minus before. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_random_walk_keeps_every_vault_equal_to_its_open_jobs`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_tokens_sent_to_a_vault_directly_belong_to_no_job_and_stay_there`.

Token-2022
- Funding in a mint with a transfer fee now or scheduled, a transfer hook program, NonTransferable, or new accounts frozen: refused wherever money enters. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_no_money_enters_in_a_mint_that_is`, `token.rs::the_extensions_that_could_block_or_tax_a_payout_are_refused_and_no_other`.
- A mint with a permanent delegate, confidential transfers, an empty hook and a zero fee (the regulated stablecoins): accepted, works end to end; the issuer's powers stay the issuer's and change no job. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_token_2022_stablecoin_with_its_usual_extensions_works_end_to_end`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_mints_issuer_keeps_its_powers_over_the_vault_and_the_job_waits`.
- A mint that turns bad after funding: no new money enters, money in escrow still leaves, the vault is debited exactly the job's amount. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_mint_that_turns_bad_takes_no_new_money_and_money_in_escrow_still_leaves`.
- A mint posing as a token account or the reverse, a multisig-sized account: the account type byte and the lengths are checked. `token.rs::a_token_account_is_read_only_from_its_own_program`.

Destinations
- A destination owned by someone else, in another mint, or the vault itself; a fee account that is not FEE_OWNER's: cases of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`.
- A frozen destination, or one that does not exist: nothing moves (the fee neither), the job stays open, and the same proof pays once the account can receive. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_frozen_or_missing_destination_moves_nothing_and_one_transaction_takes_a_job_once` (added).
- A token account a stranger created and handed to the payee's wallet: paying into it is safe, because the token programs clear the delegate when an account changes owner, and a close authority cannot move tokens. By reading; no test.

Rent and closing
- Rent of a job sent to the relayer of the payment or refund instead of whoever paid it: `rent_to` must be the job's. Case "the rent sent to someone else" of `test_a_job_is_not_paid_with`; the lamports are asserted in `test_with_no_proof_by_the_deadline_the_money_goes_back_where_it_came_from`.
- A funding relayer (anyone: a fund token is public) who later turns the account the rent goes back to into a program, so that the job could never close: in the runtime the tests run, a program account can be credited, and the job is paid and refunded. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_job_is_paid_and_refunded_whatever_the_account_its_rent_goes_to_has_become` (added). Older runtimes refused to credit an executable account; that rule (SIMD-0162) is no longer among the pending activations of any cluster in Agave's feature gate tracker (read 3 Oct 2026). Worth one check on the target cluster before real money.
- A job paid twice, or paid and refunded, inside one transaction; a closed job revived by sending it lamports: the job is emptied and handed back to the system program in the instruction that pays it, so the next instruction finds no job. Same added test; `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_proof_pays_nothing_after_the_deadline_and_no_job_twice`.
- Lamports sent to a job, vault, record, pair, bind or Balance address before it exists: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_an_address_that_was_sent_lamports_before_it_exists_is_still_created`.

Held payments, refunds, deadlines
- A held job taken by another proof, settled to a wallet the payee did not bind, settled with another user's bind, settled twice, or refunded during the hold: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_with_no_wallet_the_job_is_held_for_the_payee_and_paid_once_they_bind_one`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_held_job_returns_to_the_funder_after_180_days_and_not_before`.
- A bind hidden by passing another account so that the token's address is paid instead: the account must be the payee's bind address. `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_proof_pays_the_payees_bound_wallet_whatever_address_the_token_carries`.
- A refund before the deadline (its own second included), a payment after it, a refund after payment: `test_with_no_proof_by_the_deadline_the_money_goes_back_where_it_came_from`, `test_a_proof_pays_nothing_after_the_deadline_and_no_job_twice`.

Guardian
- A pause longer than 7 days, by anyone else, unsigned, or one that stops payments, settlements, refunds, binds or withdrawals: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_the_guardian_pauses_new_funding_only_and_nobody_else_can`. Pause writes one timestamp and sends no token instruction.

Bind
- Anything but a first-attempt `workflow_dispatch` run of the pinned claim workflow, started by the owner of a personal repository named knos-claim, on a GitHub-hosted runner: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_a_wallet_is_not_bound_with` (20 cases: other workflow file, repository or commit, push, schedule, comment, pull request, re-run, an organisation's repository, a name that only ends alike), `test_pay2_chain.py::test_nobody_binds_a_wallet_for_someone_else`.

Faucet
- Test USDC minted for a token that names a Balance of real money, or on a real-money build: `test_pay2_chain.py::test_the_faucet_mints_nothing_for_a_token_that_names_another_balance`, `test_pay2_chain.py::test_the_faucet_exists_once_and_the_real_money_build_has_none`.

By design, and not money (noted so nobody is surprised)
- A relayer who lands a later fund token of a Balance first makes the earlier one useless; the comment has to be made again. lib.rs says so.
- A funder can raise a payee's public record by paying that payee's id to a second wallet of the funder's own; it costs the fee. The record's self-payment rule sees only the funding wallet, the Balance's owner and the commenter.
- `default = ["devnet"]` in Cargo.toml: a real-money build needs `--no-default-features`. A devnet build on a real cluster would only add the faucet's own test mint.

### The payment program: defects found and fixed

none

## Reproduce it yourself

The tests. They run offline.

```
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q tests
```

Tests that need a toolchain skip and say so: the Go and Rust judge tests, the Node tests of the multisig scripts (Node 20 and `npm ci --prefix scripts`), and the check of every workflow with `actionlint`. To repeat the random walk with another seed: `KNOS_FUZZ_N=2500 KNOS_FUZZ_SEED=1 python -m pytest -q -s tests/test_pay2_chain.py -k random_walk`. The Rust tests, with the Wycheproof vectors: `cd programs-v2 && cargo test --release`.

The programs. This needs `cargo build-sbf` on the path.

```
bash scripts/build_programs_v2.sh all
```

It runs five builds. Four are copied into `tests/fixtures/` and are what the chain tests load:

- `knos_oidc_v2_test.so` and `knos_pay_v2_test.so`: test builds (`--features testkeys`).
- `knos_pay_v2_nodevnet.so`: a test build with no faucet, the rules of a real-money build.
- `knos_oidc_v2_real.so`: `knos_oidc` with no features.

The fifth, `knos_pay` with default features (the devnet build), is left in `programs-v2/target/deploy/knos_pay.so`. The script copies and pins nothing else. It and `solana-verify` both write to `programs-v2/target/deploy/` unless `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` names another folder for the script, so the later build overwrites the earlier.

`tests/fixtures/SHA256SUMS` has ten lines. Four pin those binaries. Six pin data files: one under `docs/`, one under `tests/data/`, and four fixtures of the interface crate. The script rewrites the lines of the binaries it built. `tests/test_fixtures_pinned.py` fails when a pinned file changes, and when a `*_v2_*.so` in `tests/fixtures/` is not pinned. A changed binary then shows up in review as a changed pin.

The pins do not tie the deployed program to the source. The script says the deployed binary is not its output but the `solana-verify` build, and `program.yml` says a plain `cargo build-sbf` differs from it because toolchain paths are embedded. So a rebuild on another machine can change the pins without anything being wrong. In CI, the committed test binaries are deleted before the build, so the chain tests load only what that commit's source built.

To compare a deployed program with the source, make the reproducible build the way `scripts/deploy_v2.sh` and the `verified-build` job of `program.yml` do. It needs docker.

```
solana-verify build programs-v2 --library-name knos_pay --base-image solanafoundation/solana-verifiable-build:2.3.11
solana-verify build programs-v2 --library-name knos_oidc --base-image solanafoundation/solana-verifiable-build:2.3.11
solana-verify get-executable-hash programs-v2/target/deploy/knos_pay.so
solana-verify get-program-hash -u devnet 5y7iWJ1VAMJjnnWbbdo2a2PsWJEwTExSNpzrvQSEnS8k
```

The hash from `get-executable-hash` and the hash from `get-program-hash` must be equal. Do the same for `knos_oidc` and `FkwZdsYCmzicJMtHLTkPK76bYNVG4WNwkWJBiVWNtF3W`. Without `solana-verify`, dump the program and hash it yourself:

```
solana program dump 5y7iWJ1VAMJjnnWbbdo2a2PsWJEwTExSNpzrvQSEnS8k out.so --url devnet
python3 -c "import hashlib,sys; print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read().rstrip(b'\x00')).hexdigest())" out.so
python3 -c "import hashlib,sys; print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read().rstrip(b'\x00')).hexdigest())" programs-v2/target/deploy/knos_pay.so
```

The trimming matters. `deploy_v2.sh` deploys with `--max-len` of twice the program's size, so a program deployed that way ends in zero padding. `solana-verify`'s hash ignores trailing zero bytes, and `elf_hash` in `src/knos/mainnet_check.py` does the same. `KNOS_VERIFIED_DIR=programs-v2/target/deploy knos mainnet-check` makes this comparison for both programs, on the line "on-chain bytes are this repository's verified build". Its other gates read the upgrade authority, the multisigs and the guardian from the chain, and its last gate, an outside review, fails today on purpose.

## Where an outside reviewer should start

These are the five places where a mistake costs money. They are not a scope for an audit; a reviewer should set that.

**1. The RSA arithmetic.** `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/rsa.rs`, called from `Step` in `lib.rs`. It is Montgomery multiplication written by hand on 32-bit limbs, split over several transactions, followed by a byte-for-byte check of the PKCS#1 v1.5 encoding. The Wycheproof vectors run through `verify_native`, the one-call form of the same arithmetic. The stepwise on-chain path is checked by the 120 OpenSSL verdicts and the forgery list, not by the vectors. Only 2048- and 4096-bit keys and exponent 65537 are handled. A mistake that accepts one forged signature lets anyone make a token of their own look verified. They could then pay every open bounty to a wallet of their choice, and fund bounties from any balance within its cap per bounty.

**2. The claim parser.** `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/claims.rs`, and its use in `programs-v2/knos_pay/src/gh.rs`. It decodes base64url, splits the token and finds named claims in flat JSON without a JSON library. The `aud` claim is text a workflow chooses, so it is text the attacker may write inside the signed JSON. The file has no unit tests of its own and nothing fuzzes it. It is exercised through the forgery cases, the escaped-claims test and the bit-flip comparison. A mistake lets a token signed for one repository or workflow be read as another's, which moves money that is not the signer's.

**3. Token-2022 extension screening.** `extensions_ok` and `charges` in `programs-v2/knos_pay/src/token.rs`. When money enters, the extension list is read byte by byte at fixed offsets (108 bytes for a fee configuration, 64 for a hook). Four things are refused: a non-transferable mint, accounts that start frozen, a transfer hook with a program set, and a transfer fee that takes anything now or later. Every other extension is accepted, among them a permanent delegate and confidential transfers, and so is any extension that Token-2022 adds later. The tests make mints with Token-2022 instructions in LiteSVM, in the version it bundles. A mistake lets money into a mint whose behaviour blocks or taxes payouts. Payments and refunds in that mint could then fail or arrive short, and its jobs would wait on the issuer. Other mints are not touched, since each has its own vault.

**4. The off-chain decision of who is paid.** `payee`, `payout_address` and `rejected` in `src/knos/who.py`; `evidence` and `accepted` in `src/knos/terms.py`; `src/knos/closing.py`; and `settle` in `src/knos/flow.py`, the command that decides and then asks GitHub for the token. The program checks that the bounty's own repository ran its pinned workflow, and then pays the payee that workflow named. It cannot check who earned the money, or whether the checks passed. The tests use fakes of GitHub's API, so what GitHub really answers (edit stamps, lists of closed issues, collaborator permissions, check-run listings) is what the authors assumed it answers. A mistake pays the wrong person, or pays for work whose checks did not pass. The payment is final at once, with no veto. It is limited to that funder's own bounties. That a funder's repository can lie is a known limit ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)), not a finding.

**5. The key registration attestation.** `attested` in `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/lib.rs` and the constants in `programs-v2/knos_oidc/src/pins.rs`. The program checks which file ran, at which commit, in which of the pinned account's two repositories, on which event and on which kind of runner, and that `aud` names the key's hash. The workflow it names, `drexthealpha/knos-oidc-rotate` at commit `6ddf031b64febecfcd510763ecee37637a8047fa`, is not in this repository, which holds only the calling file `.github/workflows/keys.yml`. What that workflow asks GitHub to sign is its own reading of the issuers' key sets, so a reviewer has to read it at that commit. The same repository holds `claim.yml`, which `Bind` trusts at the commit in `CLAIM_SHA` of `programs-v2/knos_pay/src/lib.rs`. The tests sign these claims themselves, with a seed key and a harness account. They cannot run the pinned workflow or the real account, because only GitHub can sign for those. A Rust test checks that the harness values exist only under `testkeys`. A mistake admits a key that GitHub does not publish. Whoever holds it can sign any token. The one-day delay and the guardian's approval are then all that stand between that key and every bounty. `python scripts/oidc_pins.py` prints the hashes of the keys the issuers publish right now, to compare with the four `GENESIS` constants in `pins.rs`. Its `--check` flag reads the first deployment's `pins.rs`, not this one.
