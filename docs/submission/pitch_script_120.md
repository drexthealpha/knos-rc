# Pitch, the two-minute cut (the finding, one transaction, the founder, the business, where it stands, the ask)

**The neutral meter for AI agent work: neither side keeps the count.**

This is the presentation video for the form. The form's own help text says the presentation runs `Up to 2 minutes`
(read signed in on 9 Oct 2026); Colosseum's page asks for "a two-to-three-minute presentation video"
([colosseum.com/hackathon](https://colosseum.com/hackathon)). This cut ends before two minutes; the longer version is
[pitch_script.md](pitch_script.md). It keeps that version's order and sentences, fewer of them: the finding first,
one transaction, the founder's record, the business, where it stands, the ask.

The spoken words are the lines that start with `>`: about 255 words, read at the pace `tests/test_pitch_cut.py`
holds them to (`2.5` words a second, the pace of the render's estimate). Each part fits before the next one starts,
and the last ends before two minutes. A spoken number is in `docs/facts.json` with its source. **No fee is spoken as
a number**: the business part shows the rate the public program ids charge, read from the chain while it is recorded.

Render it with no one at the keyboard (Piper or edge-tts, Chromium and ffmpeg: see `scripts/video/render.py`):

```
python scripts/video/render.py --script docs/submission/pitch_script_120.md
```

The lines `<!-- ... -->` below tell the render what to show; a reader of this page never sees them. The render
stops before anything is recorded if the voice runs over the limit.

<!-- `title: Knos in two minutes` -->
<!-- `voice: piper:en_US-lessac-medium, edge:en-US-AriaNeural` -->
<!-- `limit: 120` -->

## 1. The finding (0:00)

*On screen: the Agent PR Index, one row per agent.*

<!-- `show: url https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/#index` -->

> Of 241 merged agent pull requests claiming passing tests, 9 failed a test, build, lint or type check. That is
> GitHub's own record at the head commit, and each was merged anyway. Somebody approved an invoice for that work.

## 2. One transaction, seven steps (0:18)

*On screen: the site's story, the seven steps in order.*

<!-- `show: url https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/#story` -->
<!-- `scroll: 2400` -->

> Knos is the neutral meter for AI agent work: neither side keeps the count. One transaction. Agree: the price and
> the acceptance terms are fixed first. Fails: the agent edits the test, not the bug; the check refuses it, and no
> money moves. Passes: the corrected work meets the same check. Statement: both sides rebuild the same bill from
> their own ledgers. Replay: the same proof twice pays nothing. Pay: GitHub signs the run that judged the work; a
> Solana program checks that signature itself and releases the money. Verify: anyone checks the receipt offline.
> Why Solana? Money is released with no custodian, and the count is anchored where neither side can alter it.

## 3. The founder (1:07)

*On screen: the Sibyl Labs leaderboard.*

<!-- `show: url https://hack.sibyllabs.org/leaderboard` -->

> I am one founder, and I built all of it. My earlier product, a shared memory for coding agents, took first place
> of 92 teams at the Sibyl Labs hackathon.

## 4. The business (1:21)

*On screen: the price book, and the rate the public program ids charge today, read from the chain.*

<!-- `show: url https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/#pricing` -->

> The check is free. Knos earns one fee, paid by the funder on top, when value is released against a signed
> acceptance. The supplier never pays.

## 5. Where it stands (1:33)

*On screen: the Numbers view, Knos's own accounts kept apart.*

<!-- `show: url https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/#network` -->

> Where it stands, in one sentence: Solana devnet, test money, one person holds every key, no outside review,
> nobody has paid, and one other GitHub account was paid 3 times, on tasks I funded.

## 6. The ask (1:48)

*On screen: the front door, with the paste box.*

<!-- `show: url https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/` -->

> The ask: be the first buyer to run a real invoice through the check.
