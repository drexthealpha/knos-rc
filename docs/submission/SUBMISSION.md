A number that only the release run can measure is a slot, `[[stat: name]]`; `python scripts/bench_docs.py --slots`
lists the ones still open. Every field is under a thousand characters, and `tests/test_business_docs.py` counts them. Three fields state facts about the founder that nothing in the repository can back;
each says so, and the founder confirms it before pasting.

## Checklist for the day of submission

- [ ] **Confirm the Solana ecosystem track is selected in the form.** A submission with no track selected is not
      in that track.
- [ ] Both videos open for someone who is not signed in, and neither is longer than two minutes.
- [ ] Every shot that is a replay, or is played faster than it happened, carries its caption for its whole length.
- [ ] Every step of the demo is captioned with the program ids it ran on: staging program ids until
      `web/upgrades.json` shows the pending upgrade executed and a step has run on the public ones.
- [ ] Every slot of [NUMBERS.md](NUMBERS.md) holds the number its source gives on the day, zeros included.
- [ ] The repository link opens for someone who is not signed in.
- [ ] `python scripts/bench_docs.py --slots` prints no open slot, and `python scripts/claims_check.py` passes.
- [ ] `python scripts/capabilities.py check --rpc` passes, and every field and every shot says of a capability
      only the stage `docs/capabilities.json` gives it on the day, on the program ids `web/upgrades.json` says are
      live. No field states a count of capabilities: [../CAPABILITIES.md](../CAPABILITIES.md) is the count.
- [ ] `web/upgrades.json` has been read on the day. A step of the demo shows only what ran, on the program ids
      its caption names; a step whose capability has run nowhere is cut, not staged.
- [ ] The three fields marked "the founder confirms this" have been read and are true on the day.
- [ ] The last beat of the pitch and the last step of the demo have been read against the chain on the day: if an outside account has
      funded an order since this was written, the count is updated from `docs/facts.json`; if a conversation has
      happened, it is added only with the other party's agreement to be named.
- [ ] Every team member is registered on colosseum.com. Today the team is one person.

## whatBuilding

The neutral meter for AI agent work: neither side keeps the count. When agent work is sold per outcome, the
seller counts the outcomes and the buyer pays on that count. With Knos the buyer fixes, before the work, the
budget and what decides that it is done: the checks that must pass and the paths that may change, hashed at
funding. A workflow at a pinned commit reads the forge's record, the forge signs that run, and a Solana program
verifies the signature. The outcome is then counted, with no money on chain, or paid in test USDC. Each side
keeps its own ledger and computes the same statement; a difference is a named dispute, not an invoice line. A
buyer starts with an invoice it already has: pasted on the site, it is set against the neutral count, every
mismatch named. Devnet is the test mode: the record verifies from GitHub's signatures with no chain. docs/CAPABILITIES.md has the stage
of every capability, and web/upgrades.json has which builds are live on the public program ids.

## whyNow

Of 241 merged agent pull requests that claimed passing tests, 30 had a failed check at the head commit (12.4%). Of first such pull
requests, 17.8% had one: 147 of 826 repositories, and in 80 of them (9.7%) it was a test or a build. Billing by outcome has begun, and the seller keeps the count: on 14 Sep 2026 one vendor started
billing per merged changeset, another advertises that customers pay only for merged pull requests, and support
agents are sold per resolution that the vendor itself counts. The person who approves that invoice has no count
of their own. The forge already records each result and signs statements about a CI run, so its signature is a
count that neither side owns. On Solana, checking that RSA signature takes two transactions.

## repoContext

The hackathon began on 14 Sep 2026. The public repository's history starts on 1 Sep 2026. Of its 209 commits up to
Knos 0.3.11, 83 predate the hackathon: Knos 0.1 (1 to 7 Sep 2026), more work on it until 12 Sep, and daily
automatic commits. Knos 0.1 was a different product, shared memory for coding agents built on Sibyl. By
`git blame` at the 0.3.11 commit, 1.1% of the lines are older than the hackathon: the changelog entries for
Knos 0.1, the licence, package metadata and scaffolding. The other 98.9% were last changed between 30 Sep and
2 Oct 2026, and every release since was built after that. Work on two experiments that never shipped began on
13 Sep; none of their code is in the repository. The commits were written with coding agents; I review and commit
each one. docs/DISCLOSURE.md has the history by date, what came from elsewhere, what does not exist, and the
commands that reproduce every count.

## marketValidation

None yet. No buyer or supplier has been interviewed, there is no letter of intent, no pilot, no shadow count,
and nobody has paid. NUMBERS.md prints each of those as a zero. What exists is a measurement, an offer and a
plan to ask. The measurement: of 241 merged agent pull requests whose description said tests pass, 30 had a
failed check at the head commit. The buyer is whoever must approve a supplier's invoice and defend it
afterwards. An organisation is qualified when it has measurable spend on work bought per outcome, acceptance
criteria it can write down, a buyer with authority, and a problem worth another system; nobody has counted how
many there are. A maintainer's bounty is the smallest case and not the market: all open bounties on every board
came to 64,291 USD on 2 Oct 2026. The offer starts free, in shadow mode, and becomes a 30-day pilot
(docs/PILOT.md). The plan to ask is INTERVIEWS.md.

## traction

No traction is claimed beyond what the chain counts. Knos's own account funded every task paid so far, in test
USDC. By 3 Oct 2026 the two deployments had made 15 payments on devnet: 3 to one outside contributor, for bounties
Knos funded itself, and the rest to Knos's own accounts. When the release ran, 44 tasks had been
paid on the second deployment. Across both deployments, 0 paid tasks were funded by someone other than Knos with
their own tokens, by 0 funders, of whom 0 funded again. From merge to paid took 25 seconds at the median, over 40
payments. 1,905 tests pass. Buyers: none. Interviews: none. Letters of intent: none. Pilots: none, offered or
sold. Revenue: none; test USDC is not money. Outside reproductions: none known. NUMBERS.md has each of these with its
source; the site's Numbers page shows today's counts with Knos's own accounts kept apart.

## competition

Counting what an agent does and moving money for it are already sold: cloud platforms sell agent identity,
policy, evaluation and payments, and billing companies sell usage billing. So metering agents and moving
payments is not our difference. Each of them counts for one side: the platform for its own agents, the billing
system for the seller. Knos's difference is acceptance that is independent of every vendor, disagreements
included. Vendors that bill per accepted outcome count their own. GitHub's own controls gate a merge and move no
money. Bounty boards pay on a person's decision. MergePay verified GitHub's signature on an EVM chain before
Knos did on Solana; it is on a mainnet with real USDC, charges no platform fee, and is ahead there. Where Knos is
behind: devnet only, no outside security review, no payout to a bank, one person, and nobody outside has used
it. docs/COMPARE.md has every source.

## monetization

The price book (docs/MARKET.md). Check: free, forever. Pilot: one buyer, two suppliers, 30 days, one reconciled
invoice, 2,500 USD, credited against year one. Meter: 10,000 evaluations a month free per organisation, then
0.05 USD, or 0.02 on an annual commitment. Verify, proposed: 0.5% of reconciled accepted invoice value, capped
at 250 USD per deliverable. Control, per year: Team 25,000 USD, Business 80,000; Enterprise from 250,000 is not deliverable
yet. Supplier connection: 5,000 USD a year each beyond the first five, paid by the buyer. Settle: 2.5% of the
first 1,000, 1% to 50,000, 0.5% above, minimum 0.40; on devnet it is test money, zero revenue. A month's invoice
is the subscription plus the greater of the Meter and Verify charges, never both for one activity. Knos never
charges the party being rated. Nobody has bought anything, and there is no legal entity to invoice from. No
token.

## teamCommitment

One person, full time, under the handle drexthealpha, which is a pseudonym. I work with coding agents every day,
and this repository was built with them; I review and commit every change. I built it because my own agents told
me the tests passed when they had not. What I have not done: sold to the person who approves a supplier's
invoice, run a security review, or kept a service running for a customer. docs/TEAM.md names the three roles the
plan needs first: someone who has sold to engineering or finance leaders, a security lead to run an outside
review, and agent-vendor partnerships. None is hired, approached or committed. docs/GOVERNANCE.md has three
plans, none done: an outside key holder, a two-owner organisation for the pinned workflows, and the verifier
frozen after an outside review. What the project needs next: an outside key holder, first buyers to run a
shadow count, and an outside review.

## externalContributors

One outside account, jaystay-bot, wrote three pull requests: #32 (`knos_bounties` says what each bounty is about),
#33 (a repository's own record in the Agent PR Index, on the site) and #34 (a Ruby runner for the judge). Each
answers a bounty Knos funded on its own repository through the first deployment on 2 Oct 2026, in test USDC: issues
#29, #30 and #31. All three were merged on 3 Oct 2026 and paid by the first deployment's escrow. Their code has been
in the package since 0.3.12, in commits under that account's name. These payments show the path working between two
accounts. They do not show demand: Knos funded the bounties.

## legalEntity

*The founder confirms this before pasting; nothing in the repository can back it.*

None. No company has been formed for Knos. It is one person's work, published under the MIT licence.

## investmentReceived

*The founder confirms this before pasting; nothing in the repository can back it.*

None.

## liveToken

*The founder confirms this before pasting.*

No. Knos has no token of its own. It pays in the token a funder chooses, and the one it is built for is USDC. On
devnet a faucet inside the program mints test USDC, which has no value.

## liveProductLink

https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/ is the product. Paste a supplier's invoice or name a public repository: the
page shows a neutral count and every mismatch, with no install, no wallet and no sign-up. A simulated round is
below it. From there: put the workflow file in a repository, fund an issue with one comment, and see every
payment the programs have made. The code is at
https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos and the package at https://pypi.org/project/knos/. Everything is on Solana
devnet, and the money is test USDC.

## chains

Solana, on devnet. Track: Solana.

## chainUsage

Four programs on Solana devnet, with no framework. `knos-oidc`
(`FkwZdsYCmzicJMtHLTkPK76bYNVG4WNwkWJBiVWNtF3W`) verifies an RS256 OpenID Connect token on chain, in Montgomery
form, in two transactions for GitHub's keys, because one transaction's compute budget cannot hold the arithmetic.
`knos-pay` (`5y7iWJ1VAMJjnnWbbdo2a2PsWJEwTExSNpzrvQSEnS8k`) is the escrow: it reads the verified claims, checks
them against the work order, and moves SPL Token or Token-2022 tokens from the order's own account to the payees,
the relayer's tip and the fee account, or back to the funder at the deadline. `knos-meter` counts signed
evaluations and takes a fee from prepaid credits. `knos-passkey` is a wallet whose key is a WebAuthn passkey,
checked through Solana's secp256r1 instruction. Every account is a PDA. Squads holds the upgrade authority, with a
48-hour time lock, and the guardian role. The site builds and reads transactions in the browser; there is no
server.
