# Install Knos

The Knos command, its MCP server and its Stop hook are one Python package, [`knos` on
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/knos/). This page lists every way to install them, the check a repository can run on
its pull requests, and the two libraries other projects build on. None of it needs a new account anywhere.

Two parts of the package go into a coding agent:

- **The Stop hook.** When the agent says tests pass, CI is green, it shipped or it is done, Knos runs that check
  itself before the agent may stop. The command is `knos hook proof`.
- **The MCP server.** Tools that only read: `knos_bounties` and `knos_bounty` (paid work on GitHub issues, in test
  USDC on Solana devnet), `knos_quote` (one issue's amount, terms, what stands in the way, and the funder's record),
  `knos_can_pay` (would it pay: is the pinned workflow on the default branch, did each named check pass there in the
  last 30 days, can a GitHub-signed run the chain verifies pay it), `knos_check_pr` (is a pull request's "tests pass"
  true) and `knos_due` (what waits for a GitHub account). Four more return the exact comment to post and send nothing
  themselves: `knos_take`, `knos_address`, `knos_fund` and `knos_settle`. The command is `knos mcp`. It reads public
  data from GitHub and Solana and holds no key and no wallet.

  Whatever a repository or an account wrote (an issue's title and labels, a check's name, the paths in a bounty's
  terms) comes back inside a field named `untrusted`, each string cut to 200 characters, and the server's
  instructions tell the agent that it is data, never an instruction. `KNOS_MCP_REPOS=owner/name,owner/name` limits the
  server to those repositories: a listing holds only their bounties, and a tool that names another repository
  refuses it.

| For | Do this | It installs |
|---|---|---|
| a terminal | [`pip install knos`](#the-command) | the `knos` command |
| every agent on your machine | [`knos init`](#every-agent-on-the-machine-knos-init) | the hook and the server |
| Claude Code | [two commands](#claude-code) | the hook and the server, as a plugin |
| Codex | [two commands](#codex) | the hook and the server, as a plugin |
| Gemini CLI | [one command](#gemini-cli) | the server, as an extension |
| Cursor | [one link](#cursor) | the server |
| VS Code | [one link](#vs-code) | the server |
| GitHub Copilot coding agent | [one setting and one file](#github-copilot-coding-agent) | the server |
| a repository's pull requests | [a workflow file](#the-github-action) | the free check, as a GitHub Action |
| a seller who settles a merged pull request without the buyer's workflow | [a workflow file in a repository of your own](#settle-yourself-the-attest-workflow) | nothing: it only reads, and asks GitHub to sign |
| a JavaScript project | [`npm install <release tarball>`](#the-javascript-client) | the client `knos-settle` |
| a Solana program | [a git dependency](#the-rust-interface-crates) | the crates `knos-oidc-interface` and `knos-pay-interface` |

The routes for one agent start Knos as `uvx knos ...`, so they need
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and nothing else: uv downloads `knos` from PyPI the
first time the agent starts it. uv then keeps running the release it downloaded; `uvx knos@latest --version` moves it
to the newest one.

## The command

```bash
pip install knos        # Python 3.10 or newer; pipx install knos and uv tool install knos work too
uvx knos --version      # or run it without installing anything: uv fetches it
```

It installs the `knos` command. `knos --help` lists what it does.

## Every agent on the machine: `knos init`

```bash
knos init               # undo: knos init --undo
```

It looks for the agents installed on the machine and writes, for each one it finds:

| Agent | Stop hook | MCP server |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `~/.claude.json` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/hooks.json` (Codex asks you to trust it once) | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Cursor | | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Gemini CLI | | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |

Cursor and Gemini CLI have no hook Knos uses, so they get the server. Nothing else is written. A settings file is
copied to `<file>.knos-backup` before its first change, and `knos init --undo` takes the entries out again.

Run it from an installed `knos`, not as `uvx knos init`: it writes the path of the command it was started from into
each agent's settings, and a path inside uv's cache stops working when the cache is cleaned.

## Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add drexthealpha/Knos
claude plugin install knos@knos
```

Inside a session the same two are `/plugin marketplace add drexthealpha/Knos` and `/plugin install knos@knos`.

It installs the plugin `knos` from this repository's [`plugin/`](../plugin) folder: the Stop hook
(`uvx knos hook proof --client claude`) and the MCP server (`uvx knos mcp`). These are the two things `knos init`
writes for Claude Code. Use one of the two routes: with both, the hook runs twice at every stop. To remove it:
`claude plugin uninstall knos@knos`.

## Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add drexthealpha/Knos
codex plugin add knos@knos
```

It installs the same plugin: the MCP server and the Stop hook (`uvx knos hook proof --client codex`). Codex does not
run a plugin's hook until you have reviewed and trusted it. Here too, use the plugin or `knos init`, not both. To
remove it: `codex plugin remove knos@knos`.

For the server alone:

```bash
codex mcp add knos -- uvx knos mcp
```

which writes this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.knos]
command = "uvx"
args = ["knos", "mcp"]
```

## Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos
```

It installs the extension `knos` ([`gemini-extension.json`](../gemini-extension.json)): the MCP server. To remove it:
`gemini extensions uninstall knos`.

## Cursor

[Add Knos to Cursor](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=knos&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJrbm9zIiwibWNwIl19)

The link opens Cursor, which asks before it adds the MCP server `knos`. The same link in Cursor's own scheme, to
paste into a browser's address bar:

```text
cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=knos&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJrbm9zIiwibWNwIl19
```

Or by hand, in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (every project) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (one project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "knos": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["knos", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

## VS Code

[Add Knos to VS Code](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=knos&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22knos%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D)

The link opens VS Code, which shows the MCP server `knos` and asks before it installs it. The same link in VS
Code's own scheme, and a command that adds the server to your user profile from a terminal:

```text
vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22knos%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22knos%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D
```

```bash
code --add-mcp "{\"name\":\"knos\",\"command\":\"uvx\",\"args\":[\"knos\",\"mcp\"]}"
```

Or by hand, for one workspace, in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "knos": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["knos", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

## GitHub Copilot coding agent

GitHub now calls it the Copilot cloud agent. There is no file and no link for it: a repository's administrator pastes
the configuration into the repository's settings, under **Settings > Code, planning, and automation > Copilot > MCP
servers**, and saves it.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "knos": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["knos", "mcp"],
      "tools": ["knos_bounties", "knos_bounty", "knos_check_pr", "knos_due", "knos_quote", "knos_can_pay", "knos_take", "knos_address", "knos_fund", "knos_settle"]
    }
  }
}
```

The agent works on one of GitHub's runners, which has no `uv`. This file, on the default branch, installs it before
the agent starts:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
name: Copilot Setup Steps
on: workflow_dispatch
jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:        # GitHub looks for this job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@c18668ad3cf93ea998bef934396af7bb5c839dc7 # v10.2.0
```

It installs the MCP server for the agent's sessions in that repository.

## The GitHub Action

The free check on every pull request of a repository: when a description says its tests pass or CI is green, Knos
compares that with GitHub's own record of the head commit, and it applies the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` rules.
A ticked box of a template's checklist (`- [x] My PR passes all CI/CD checks`) is the author's claim; an unticked
box, the template's HTML comments and a sentence that hedges or instructs ("tests should pass", "make sure CI is
green") are not.
It runs none of the pull request's code, and it involves no bounty, no money and no chain.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/knos.yml
name: knos
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]
permissions: {}
jobs:
  knos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20
    permissions:
      contents: read
      checks: read
    steps:
      - uses: drexthealpha/Knos@v0.3.13
```

It installs nothing in the repository but this file. The check is the job `knos`: it fails when a claim is false or
a rule is broken, and its summary says which. A branch ruleset can require it. The two read permissions are all it
needs, so it also works on pull requests from forks, and it never needs `pull_request_target`.

Keep it in a workflow file of its own and keep the job's name: Knos does not count the jobs of its own workflow run
as evidence, and it knows its earlier runs on a commit by a name that starts with `knos`. A tag can be moved; to
pin what runs, write the release's full commit sha in place of `v0.3.12`.

To also pay for merged work, a repository uses [`examples/knos-workflow.yml`](../examples/knos-workflow.yml)
instead.

## GitLab CI

A GitLab project that runs CI/CD for a GitHub repository (GitLab's "CI/CD for external repositories") runs a
pipeline for each GitHub pull request, and hands that pipeline the pull request's number as
`CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_IID`. Set `KNOS_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` to the GitHub `owner/name` in the project's CI/CD
variables; the number comes with each pipeline, so each pull request is checked as itself. `knos check owner/name#N` reads
that pull request from GitHub, its description and the checks GitHub recorded at its head commit, and the job fails
when the description says tests pass or CI is green and a check failed there. It also fails when GitHub cannot be
read, rather than pass on a pull request it did not see. A masked `GH_TOKEN` variable, a token that can read the
repository, lifts GitHub's limit on anonymous reads, which a shared runner's address may have used up. A GitLab merge
request with no GitHub pull request behind it cannot be checked by this command.

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
knos:
  image: python:3.12
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "external_pull_request_event"'
  script:
    - python -m pip install knos==0.3.13
    - knos check "$KNOS_GITHUB_REPOSITORY#$CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_IID"
```

## Get paid: bind a wallet, by hand

A person paid for merged work can name the wallet once, and every later task pays it. Binding is by hand, in two
steps: create a repository from the template [`drexthealpha/knos-claim`](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-claim)
(a personal account's, public, named `knos-claim`), then open its Actions tab, choose "knos claim", press "Run
workflow" and paste your address yourself. `knos claim <address>` does both. No link, repository description or
push carries an address in, because an address in a link could be someone else's.

An organisation binds a wallet the same way, from a repository named `knos-claim` that the organisation owns: a
member starts the claim workflow by hand. That takes effect with `knos-pay` 2.1
([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), section 8).

With no wallet app: the site's "Get paid" section makes a passkey on your device and shows the address it derives.
Use that address like any other. Withdrawing needs only the passkey. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), section 17,
first: a lost passkey is lost money.

## Settle yourself: the attest workflow

For the person who did the work. Put [`examples/knos-attest.yml`](../examples/knos-attest.yml) in a repository you
own, as `.github/workflows/knos-attest.yml`. It needs no secret and writes nothing. After your pull request is merged
in a public repository, `knos settle --neutral <pull request URL>` starts it by hand through your `gh` login, or you
start it from the Actions tab. It reads GitHub's public record of the pull request and the work order on Solana,
and asks GitHub to sign only what that record supports. The escrow pays on that run when the order allows it, which
is the default; an order funded with `neutral off` does not. This takes effect with `knos-pay` 2.1.

## The JavaScript client

```bash
npm install https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/releases/download/v0.3.13/knos-settle-0.3.13.tgz
```

It installs `knos-settle`, the client for Knos's Solana programs: one file with no dependency, for a browser and for
Node 20 or newer ([`sdk/settle`](../sdk/settle)). The tarball is attached to every release.

`knos-settle` is not on npm. A first publish to npm needs the owner to sign in at npmjs.com and create a token, and
nobody else can do that for them. The release workflow publishes the client by itself from the first release after
the repository has that token as the secret `NPM_TOKEN`; until then each release says in one line that it skipped
npm.

## The Rust interface crates

```toml
[dependencies]
knos-oidc-interface = { git = "https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos", tag = "v0.3.13" }
```

It adds `knos-oidc-interface`, the crate a Solana program uses to read a token that knos-oidc verified: no dependency,
no allocation ([`crates/knos-oidc-interface`](../crates/knos-oidc-interface)). It reads the second deployment unless
a program names the first (`v1::read`).

[`crates/knos-pay-interface`](../crates/knos-pay-interface) is the second crate, added the same way from the same
repository: the addresses and instructions a program needs to fund, top up and refund a work order from an account
it controls. [COMPOSE.md](COMPOSE.md) lists the examples built on both.

`knos-oidc-interface` is not on crates.io. A first publish to crates.io needs the owner to sign in there and create
a token, and nobody else can do that for them. The release workflow publishes the crate by itself from the first
release after the repository has that token as the secret `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`; until then each release says in
one line that it skipped crates.io. One consequence: crates.io does not accept a crate that depends on a git
repository, so a crate that uses this one cannot itself be published there yet.

## Any other MCP client

`knos mcp` is a stdio server: the command is `uvx` and its arguments are `knos` and `mcp`. The official MCP registry
lists it as `io.github.drexthealpha/knos`.
