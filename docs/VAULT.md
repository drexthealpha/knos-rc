# The vault: evidence that outlives devnet and the operator

An evidence bundle (`knos bundle make`) holds everything a payment's verdict was derived from: the receipt, the token
the issuer signed, the key, the terms, and an archived copy of the chain record. [RECEIPT.md](RECEIPT.md) says what
`knos bundle verify --no-chain` proves from it when the cluster is gone. This page is about keeping it: sealed to the
people who may open it, exported in plain for the customer, removed on a schedule, and checkpointed so that anyone
can later show a bundle existed.

Nothing here needs a server, an account, a cluster or Knos's operator. The code is `src/knos/vault.py` and
`src/knos/vault_crypto.py`; the tests are `tests/test_vault.py`.

What has and has not happened: the commands are implemented and tested here with fixed keys. No customer keeps a
vault, and no checkpoint root has been anchored anywhere outside a test.

## The commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `knos vault keygen buyer` | one party's key pair. The file stays with that party; the line it prints (`buyer=<64 hex>`) is what the others seal to |
| `knos vault seal FILE --to buyer=... --to supplier=... --to auditor=...` | seals one bundle into the vault folder as `<sha256 of the bundle>.vault`. Each recipient opens it alone |
| `knos vault open FILE.vault --key buyer.vaultkey.json` | the bundle again, checked against the hash in the header |
| `knos vault export VAULT --key KEYFILE --out knos-evidence.tar` | a plain archive of every bundle, with a checkpoint. Not encrypted: the customer's own copy |
| `knos vault restore knos-evidence.tar --to DIR` | the bundles out of that archive, each checked against the archive's checkpoint |
| `knos vault retain VAULT --policy FILE [--dry-run]` | applies a retention policy; `--dry-run` prints what would go and touches nothing |
| `knos vault checkpoint VAULT [--previous FILE] [--sign KEYPAIR]` | one hash over every bundle hash, and the line to write down |
| `knos vault verify CHECKPOINT [--against VAULT, ARCHIVE or DIR] [--key KEYFILE] [--root ROOT]` | checks the checkpoint and that everything it lists is held. No chain, no network |

## The sealed file, version 1

One JSON object on one line, keys in order, no spaces. `type` is `knos.vault`, `version` is 1.

| field | what it is |
|---|---|
| `kem`, `aead` | `x25519-hkdf-sha256`, `chacha20-poly1305`. A reader refuses any other value by name |
| `name` | the bundle's file name: letters, digits, dot, dash, underscore |
| `plain_sha256`, `size` | the SHA-256 and the length of the bundle before sealing |
| `sealed_at` | seconds since 1970 |
| `ephemeral` | base64 of a 32-byte X25519 public key made for this file alone |
| `recipients` | in order of label: `{id, label, public, wrapped}`. `public` is the recipient's X25519 key, `id` the first 16 hex characters of its SHA-256, `wrapped` the content key sealed for that recipient (48 bytes) |
| `nonce` | base64 of 12 random bytes |
| `ciphertext` | base64 of the bundle under ChaCha20-Poly1305, its 16-byte tag at the end |

How it is made:

1. Draw 32 random bytes for an ephemeral X25519 private key, 32 for the content key, 12 for the nonce.
2. `bound` = SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of the header: `type, version, kem, aead, name, plain_sha256, size,
   sealed_at, ephemeral` and each recipient's `id, label, public`.
3. For each recipient: `shared = X25519(ephemeral private, recipient public)`;
   `key = HKDF-SHA256(shared, salt = ephemeral public || recipient public, info = "knos.vault.v1 key wrap")`, 32 bytes;
   `wrapped = ChaCha20-Poly1305(key, nonce = 12 zero bytes, content key, associated data = bound)`. Each wrapping key
   is used for exactly one message, which is why a fixed nonce is safe there.
4. `ciphertext = ChaCha20-Poly1305(content key, nonce, bundle, associated data = bound)`.

Because both seals carry `bound`, changing the name, the date, the size, a label, or adding or dropping a recipient
makes every open fail. A public key that would give an all-zero shared secret is refused.

The primitives are X25519 ([RFC 7748](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748)), HKDF-SHA256
([RFC 5869](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869)) and ChaCha20-Poly1305
([RFC 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8439)). Knos has no runtime dependency for cryptography, so they are
written out in `vault_crypto.py` from the standard library and tested against the RFCs' vectors. When the
`cryptography` package is installed it is used instead, and a test holds the two to the same bytes.

### Test vector

[`tests/data/vault_v1.json`](../tests/data/vault_v1.json) holds three private keys, the ephemeral key, the content
key, the nonce, a plaintext and the sealed file they give. Every secret in it is SHA-256 of a label and is used for
nothing else.

| | |
|---|---|
| plaintext SHA-256 | `d1dc5cedfce749fffcf06e1d72f6f2769f37eac4fcd5450a2795b4ef325237c8` |
| sealed file SHA-256 | `a5dffe21caac592812621178bae1e611504e7ac220aa8d4797630ac87086962a` |
| checkpoint root over that one bundle | `c330ddd000ea9483afabe1ed1499414c4e5ec37e339fdaa9ceb4e3ea9dd355ff` |

An implementation in another language is right when it writes that sealed file from those inputs and opens it with
each of the three keys.

## What the header shows, and to whom

The header is in the clear on purpose: a checkpoint and a retention policy work without any key. Whoever stores a
sealed file therefore sees how many bundles there are, how large, when each was sealed, and the labels and public
keys of the recipients. They do not see a repository, an amount, a payee or a verdict. If the labels themselves are
confidential, use neutral ones (`a`, `b`, `c`).

## Checkpoints

A checkpoint is `{type: knos.vault-checkpoint, version: 1, at, count, entries, root, previous, signature}`.
`entries` are the bundles' SHA-256 hashes in order. `root` is the SHA-256 of the bytes `knos.vault.checkpoint.v1`,
one zero byte, the count as 8 bytes (big-endian), and the hashes as raw bytes in order. `previous` is the root of the
checkpoint before, so a series of them forms a chain. With `--sign` the checkpoint carries an Ed25519 signature made
with a Solana keypair file; without it, it is a hash.

The command prints one line, `knos-vault-checkpoint:v1:<root>`. Put it somewhere both parties will find it later
and neither can rewrite alone: an email to the other side, a transaction memo, a notary's register. That is all
"anchoring" means here, and no place is required.

What `knos vault verify` then shows: the root is the hash of the entries, the signature holds if there is one, and
every listed bundle is held (in a vault folder, an export archive or a folder of plain bundles). With `--root` it
also holds the checkpoint to the root you wrote down. It shows that a bundle held today is one of those that existed
when the root was written down. It does not show that the bundle is true; `knos bundle verify` does that, from the
issuer's signature. A signature says a key's holder made the checkpoint; who holds the key is not in the file.

## Retention

A policy is one file ([`examples/private/retention.json`](../examples/private/retention.json)):

```json
{"type": "knos.retention-policy", "version": 1, "keep_years": 7, "then": "hashes"}
```

`keep_years` counts years of 365 days from `sealed_at`. `then` is `delete` (the sealed file is removed and nothing
is kept) or `hashes` (the sealed file is removed and its hash, name, size and dates stay in `hashes.json`, so older
checkpoints still verify and say "hash only"). `--dry-run` prints each bundle with its age and what would happen.

Three limits. The age comes from the header, which only a key holder can confirm. Removing a file from one folder
removes it from that folder: a copy the other party or an auditor holds is theirs. And a bundle whose hash alone is
kept can no longer prove anything about its contents to anyone.

## The restore test

`tests/test_vault.py::test_restore_from_the_export_alone_after_the_working_copy_and_the_chain_are_gone`, and the row
"devnet is reset and the operator's copies are deleted" in [DRILLS.md](DRILLS.md): a bundle is sealed to three keys
and exported; the working folder is deleted and the chain forgets the order; the archive alone is restored; and
`knos bundle verify --no-chain --no-network` passes on every restored receipt. The test chain holds one order, so
"every" is one bundle there. It has not been rehearsed with a customer's archive.

## Limits

- The standard-library code is not constant-time; nothing written in Python is. Sealing and opening are done by a
  person on their own machine. On a shared machine, install `cryptography`.
- There is no key recovery. A lost key file opens nothing; that is why a bundle is sealed to more than one party.
- A recipient cannot be removed from a file that was already handed out. Seal again to the new set and delete the old
  file where you can.
- An export is plain. It is the customer's durable copy and must be kept like a contract.
- This is evidence of what was signed and recorded. Money on devnet is test USDC, and none of it is recovered by a
  restore.
