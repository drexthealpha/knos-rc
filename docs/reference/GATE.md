# The upgrade gate: put your program behind it

## One pull request

The three lines that make the gate yours (`adopt.py init` writes them; nothing else in the Rust package, or crate,
changes):

```rust
solana_program::declare_id!("GATE_ADDRESS");
pub const KNOS_REPO_ID: u64 = 123456789;
pub const WORKFLOW: &[u8] = b"OWNER/REPO/.github/workflows/knos-gate.yml@";
```

The install link: `init --link OWNER/REPO` (command 1 below) prints a link. It opens GitHub's page for adding
`.github/workflows/knos-gate.yml` to your repository, already filled in, as a pull request. The site's Install page
builds the same kind of link for `knos.yml` (`installLink` in [`web/install.js`](../../web/install.js)). That workflow builds your
program on a GitHub-hosted runner on `main` and on release tags, and has your gate record the build. It needs one
secret, `GATE_FEE_PAYER`: a key with a little devnet SOL that can do nothing else.

What each record proves: GitHub's own runner ran that workflow file, from that repository, at a named commit of
`main` or a release tag, and built program bytes whose hash is the one in the record `["build", program, hash]`. `check` then shows, before a vote, whether each pending upgrade's buffer holds recorded
bytes. It does not prove the commit is good, and nothing on chain makes the multisig wait for a record ("What it
cannot do", below).

Before the pull request: deploy your gate once (command 1) and hand your program to a time-locked multisig
(command 2). Teams that already build in a workflow of their own can add the job in `my_gate/gate-job.yml` to it
instead; `--workflow` then names that file.

The gate makes a program upgrade wait a public delay, and lets anyone check that the new program code is exactly what
GitHub's runner built from a named commit. It is for any Solana team whose program is upgradeable. Devnet only.

It is three parts. Two exist already; you deploy one.

| part | whose | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| a Squads v4 multisig (an account that acts only when several keys agree) with a time lock | yours | holds your program's upgrade authority; an approved upgrade waits the time lock, in public, and a vote can cancel it |
| `knos-oidc` on devnet, `FkwZdsYCmzicJMtHLTkPK76bYNVG4WNwkWJBiVWNtF3W` | already deployed | checks, on chain, GitHub's signature on the identity token a workflow run receives (an OpenID Connect token) |
| a gate program, [`examples/upgrade_gate`](../../examples/upgrade_gate) with three lines changed | yours | writes the record `["build", program, executable hash]` only on a token from YOUR build workflow, on `main` or a release tag, on a GitHub-hosted runner |

Adopters today: 0 ([COMPOSE.md](COMPOSE.md), "Who uses the upgrade gate"). Knos's own four programs are behind it
([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)).

## Three commands

Before them, once: a Squads v4 multisig whose time lock is your delay. The time lock is a number of seconds on the
multisig account (`timeLock` of `multisigCreateV2` in the Squads SDK; `SetTimeLock` in a config transaction:
[Squads documentation](https://docs.squads.so/main/development/cli/commands)). Knos uses 172,800 s, 48 hours. You
also need the Knos repository checked out and installed (`pip install .`), and the Solana command line.

**1. Make your gate.** It needs no network. It writes your own copy of the gate program (a Rust crate) and the job your build workflow adds.

```bash
python examples/upgrade_gate/adopt.py init --repo-id 123456789 --workflow OWNER/REPO/.github/workflows/knos-gate.yml --gate-id GATE_ADDRESS --out my_gate --link OWNER/REPO
```

`--repo-id` is `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq .id`; `--gate-id` is `solana address -k gate.json` of a key you made.
Then build and deploy it with your own key, as any program:
`cd my_gate && cargo build-sbf && solana program deploy -u devnet --program-id gate.json target/deploy/upgrade_gate.so`.
Open the link it printed and propose the file as a pull request (or copy `my_gate/.github/workflows/knos-gate.yml`
by hand; set `PROGRAM` and `MANIFEST` in it to your program). After each build on `main` or a tag it asks GitHub to
sign `gate:<program>:<hash>` and has the gate record it (`adopt.py record`, fees from a key that holds no power).

**2. Hand your program to the multisig's vault.** This is the step that cannot be undone by you alone.

```bash
solana program set-upgrade-authority PROGRAM_ADDRESS --new-upgrade-authority VAULT_ADDRESS --skip-new-upgrade-authority-signer-check
```

From here only a proposal the members approved, and that waited the time lock, can change the program.

**3. Check before every vote.**

```bash
python examples/upgrade_gate/adopt.py check --gate GATE_ADDRESS --program PROGRAM_ADDRESS --multisig MULTISIG_ADDRESS --json upgrades.json
```

It reads every pending upgrade of the program in the multisig and prints, for each, whether the gate holds a
record for the bytes in its buffer, and from which commit. Exit 0 only when every one is recorded. A member who
votes without running it can only rely on building the program again themselves and comparing.

## An upgrade, afterwards

```bash
solana program write-buffer target/deploy/PROGRAM.so --buffer buffer.json
solana program set-buffer-authority BUFFER_ADDRESS --new-buffer-authority VAULT_ADDRESS
python examples/upgrade_gate/adopt.py expect --gate GATE_ADDRESS --program PROGRAM_ADDRESS target/deploy/PROGRAM.so
python examples/upgrade_gate/adopt.py check --gate GATE_ADDRESS --program PROGRAM_ADDRESS --buffer BUFFER_ADDRESS
```

`expect` prints the executable hash (what `solana-verify get-executable-hash` prints), the audience your workflow
signs and the record's address. Write the build your workflow made, not one from your machine: the record is of
those bytes. Then propose the loader's `Upgrade` in your multisig (a vault transaction), vote, wait, execute.

Knos does the same steps for its own programs with one script that also proposes and votes:
`bash scripts/deploy_v2.sh --propose`, then `node scripts/governance.mjs upgrade execute <index>`. That script names
Knos's four programs and its own multisig; it does not take another team's.

## The feed and the banner

`check --json upgrades.json` writes what it found: the multisig's time lock and threshold, and for each pending
upgrade its buffer, whether it is recorded, the sentence above, and `earliest_execution` (unix seconds; null until
approved). Run it on a schedule and publish the file beside your site. This banner reads it:

```html
<p id="upgrade-banner" hidden></p>
<script type="module">
  const f = await (await fetch("upgrades.json")).json(), p = f.entries ?? [];
  const el = document.getElementById("upgrade-banner");
  if (p.length) {
    const due = Math.min(...p.map((e) => e.earliest_execution ?? Infinity));
    el.textContent = `${p.length} program upgrade${p.length === 1 ? "" : "s"} pending`
      + (Number.isFinite(due) ? `, can run from ${new Date(due * 1000).toISOString().slice(0, 16)}Z` : ", not approved yet")
      + (f.ok ? "" : ". NOT every build is recorded by the gate.");
    el.hidden = false;
  }
</script>
```

Knos's own feed is richer: [`web/upgrades.json`](../../web/upgrades.json) and the Atom feed `web/upgrades.xml` keep
every proposal, executed and replaced ones too ([`scripts/upgrade_feed.py`](../../scripts/upgrade_feed.py)). The same
script writes that full feed for your programs:

```
python scripts/upgrade_feed.py --ids my_ids.json --gate GATE_ADDRESS --out my_feed
```

`my_ids.json` is `{"upgrade_multisig": "MULTISIG_ADDRESS", "programs": {"my_program": "PROGRAM_ADDRESS"}}`. The feed's
title and links are still worded for Knos: edit the two files' headings before you publish them.

## What it has shown

- **A defect found inside the delay.** The `knos_pay` build proposed in Knos release 0.3.13 let a pay token that had paid
  one order pay a second. It was found while the proposal waited and withdrawn before it could run; no order was exposed
  ([CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), 0.3.14; [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md), section 3). The delay gave the time; a
  person still had to look.
- **An execution that did not happen.** Proposals 3 to 6 are in the feed with the time each could first run and
  the time the multisig marked it executed. The time it was marked
  executed is about five hours after the time it could first run: the run scheduled for that first time failed
  before it sent anything, and nothing reported the failure. The feed showed four proposals still
  `pending` after their time, which is how it was seen ([`web/upgrades.json`](../../web/upgrades.json), `entries`:
  `earliest_execution_utc` and `since`).

## What it cannot do

- **It does not say the commit is good.** A record says which commit to read. Nobody is made to read it.
- **Nothing on chain enforces the record.** The Squads program executes any approved upgrade after the time lock.
  The record is checked by `check`, by people. A team that wants it enforced must check the record in a program.
- **The delay is notice, not oversight,** unless the multisig's members are different people. Knos's are not:
  all three keys are the founder's ([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)).
- **It trusts GitHub:** its signing keys, its hosted runners, and that your workflow file builds what it says.
- **It depends on `knos-oidc`,** which Knos's multisig can upgrade after a 48-hour wait. The GitHub signing
  keys it holds each expire 30 days after their last refresh ([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md), section 8). If it stops, no new record can be
  written; your multisig and its delay go on.
- **Nobody is told.** The file and the banner reach someone who looks.
- **Not run by anyone else yet.** `init`, `expect` and `check` are tested here, and `record` against Knos's own
  gate in a simulator ([`tests/test_gate_adopt.py`](../../tests/test_gate_adopt.py)). A gate made by `init` has not
  been built from the tag or deployed, and `record` has not been sent to devnet for another team's gate. The
  workflow `init` writes and its link are checked here ([`tests/test_gate_link.py`](../../tests/test_gate_link.py)); it
  has not run in any repository.
- **Devnet only.** `knos-oidc` is not on mainnet.
