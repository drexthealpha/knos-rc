# Knos

**Knos pays for software work on signed acceptance: terms fixed before the work, a GitHub-signed run attests they were met, a Solana program settles.**

A work order is a task, its budget and the terms that decide whether it is done, fixed before the work starts. A
bounty on an issue is the smallest work order. When the work is merged, a workflow run that GitHub signs says whether
the terms were met, and a Solana program checks that signature itself before it pays. No person holds the money in
between.

<!-- recording: the release puts the poster image on the next line, linked to the same file -->
**Recording:** [one work order, from its funding to its payment](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/releases/latest/download/demo.mp4).
The file is `demo.mp4`, attached to the latest release. A release with no recording has no such file, and the link
then finds nothing.

**Try it in one minute, with no wallet.** Open [drexthealpha.github.io/Knos](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/).
Under the first form are three buttons. Each puts a real input in the form and shows the result:

- **A claim that is true:** an agent's pull request says its tests pass, and GitHub's own checks agree.
- **A claim that is false:** a pull request says it passes all CI, and a check of its latest commit failed.
- **A task that was paid:** the transaction on Solana devnet that paid a task. Knos's own account paid itself
  there, in test USDC, to show the path.

One buyer, one work order, one acceptance, one payment, and then the next order:

1. **A buyer.** A maintainer has an issue she would pay 20 USDC to have fixed.
2. **A work order.** She comments on the issue: `/knos fund 20 checks: test`. The money goes into a token account
   that belongs to this order alone, and she pays Knos's fee on top of it, so whoever does the work receives the
   full amount.
   Knos replies with the terms: paid when a pull request that closes this issue is merged, if the check `test`
   passed at that pull request's last commit. The terms are logged on chain and nothing changes them afterwards.
3. **An acceptance.** Someone opens a pull request: a person, or a coding agent somebody runs. She merges it. Had
   `test` failed at that commit, her merge would pay nothing, and a comment would name the check that failed.
4. **A payment.** A workflow at a pinned commit reads GitHub's record of the merge and asks GitHub to sign what it
   found. A Solana program checks GitHub's signature and pays the author's wallet. Her own repository's workflow does
   this on the merge. If it does not, the seller can: after a merge in a public repository he runs the pinned
   `attest.yml` by hand in a repository of his own (`knos settle --neutral <pull request URL>`), and the program pays
   on that run too. A buyer who deletes her workflow after merging no longer withholds the payment.
5. **A repeat.** She comments `/knos fund 20` on the next issue.

Two options are fixed at funding, and both are off unless the funder asks. A **warranty**: `warranty 14 holdback 20`
keeps that share of each payment in the order for that many days, and it goes back to the funder if the work is
reverted in that time. An **arbiter**: `arbiter @login` names a person both sides accept, who can rule who is paid
when they disagree.

## Why

Coding agents open pull requests by the million, and a pull request's own description is not evidence.

<!-- bench:headline -->
**Agent PR Index, 2026-10-02.** In 826 repositories, the first pull request by an AI coding agent whose description said tests or CI pass had:

- **a failed check of any kind** at its head commit in 147 (17.8%; 95% interval 15.3% to 20.6%);
- **a failed test, build, lint or type-check job** in 80 (9.7%; 95% interval 7.9% to 11.9%). Names decide this one, so read it as the cautious figure.

Of the 241 merged agent pull requests in the smaller sample that records merges, 30 (12.4%) had a failed check while their description said tests pass. A failed check is GitHub's record, not a judgment of why it failed.
<!-- /bench:headline -->

So nobody pays an agent on its word. Agents are mostly billed by the seat or by the token, and vendors that have
started to bill per accepted change count the changes themselves ([docs/MARKET.md](docs/MARKET.md), section 1).
Code has what most agent work lacks: a third party that already records the result. GitHub records who opened a
pull request, what its checks concluded and who merged it, and it signs statements about a workflow run. A letter
of credit works the same way: the bank pays against a document a third party signed, never against the seller's
word. Here the document is GitHub's signed token and the bank is a program. [docs/WHY.md](docs/WHY.md) has the
argument and its sources.

One limit belongs next to that picture. GitHub signs which workflow ran, at which commit, in which repository,
started by whom, and on which kind of runner. It does not sign what the workflow read. That the checks passed is the
pinned workflow's own reading of GitHub's record. [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) says who is still trusted in
each case, and what each could do wrong.

## How it works

**Install.** One workflow file in the repository, `.github/workflows/knos.yml`
([examples/knos-workflow.yml](examples/knos-workflow.yml)). It needs no secret, and nothing in the repository holds
a key or money. A second, optional file puts a check on every pull request
([examples/knos-check.yml](examples/knos-check.yml)). A buyer who owns no repository of the work funds from the
site instead, once the upgrade below has executed: "Fund any issue" takes the address of any public issue and a
wallet, and needs no file in that repository.

**Fund with terms.** The repository's owner, or someone the owner lets spend its balance, comments on an issue:

```
/knos fund 20 checks: test, build paths: src/** days 30 reserve 3 warranty 14 holdback 20 arbiter @login
```

Only the amount is needed. The rest are the terms, fixed at that moment:

- `checks`: the checks that must have passed at the merged pull request's last commit. With none named, Knos takes
  the checks the repository's `.knos/policy.yml` names, else the default branch's required status checks, else
  every check that ran to an end on the default branch's latest commit. A repository with no checks gets none, and
  the reply says so: "your merge alone is the acceptance".
- `paths`: the files a pull request may change. By default it may not change `.github/**` or `.knos/**`, so it
  cannot edit what judges it.
- `days`: how long the money waits for a payment before it goes back (14 by default, 90 at most).
- `reserve`: how many days a contributor's `/knos take` holds the issue (7 by default).
- `warranty` and `holdback`: days, and the share in percent that waits through them (at most 90 days and 50%).
- `arbiter`: who rules on a dispute. `neutral off`: only the funder's own repository may sign the payment.

Other comments: `/knos offer @vendor rate 12 budget 100` is a standing order that pays one vendor that rate for each
accepted change until the budget is spent. `/knos split @a 60 @b 40` shares one payment between up to four people.
`/knos cancel` ends an order with 7 days' notice, and a valid payment inside the notice still pays. `/knos help`
lists the rest, and every comment that starts with `/knos` gets a reply.

On devnet a faucet inside the program mints the test USDC, so the comment is all it takes. With a token of real
value the owner first sets money aside from a wallet: a Balance for one GitHub owner, with a cap per order, limits
per day and in total, the repositories that may spend it, and up to four other GitHub accounts that may spend it by
comment. Only that wallet can take unspent money back out.

**Who is paid, and where.** The person who opened the pull request. When a bot account opened it (a coding agent),
a person or an organisation is paid only on an act GitHub authenticates: the issue is assigned to them, a
maintainer wrote `/knos pay @login`, they are an assignee of the pull request and wrote `/knos mine`, or the
order was a standing offer to that vendor. A line in the description never decides. The money goes to the wallet
bound to that GitHub account, else to the address in their own `/knos address <address>` comment. With neither, the
order is held for them for 180 days and then goes back to the funder. A payee with no wallet app can use a passkey:
the site makes one, and a program on Solana pays out on that passkey's signature.

**No payment.** With no payment by the deadline, the amount and the fee go back where they came from. A refund
needs no token, so it works whatever happens to GitHub or to Knos.

**Paid without a merge, for a black-box check only.** The funder's check sits in `.knos/acceptance/<issue>/` before
funding and is fixed by its hash in the terms. The submission runs as a separate process in a sandbox and only its
output is compared. The reason is measured in [docs/TAMPER.md](docs/TAMPER.md): of 63 cheating pull requests, plain
CI passed 56, acceptance tests that run in the same process as the code passed 7, and the black-box check passed
none.

**Counted without an escrow.** A buyer who pays a vendor by invoice can still have a neutral count. `knos-meter`
records each evaluation GitHub signed, accepted or rejected, once, and either side can recompute a month's count
from the program's logs (`statement` in [`src/knos/settle/v2/meter.py`](src/knos/settle/v2/meter.py)). It moves no
customer money.

## What exists nowhere else

Read on 2 Oct and 3 Oct 2026. [docs/COMPARE.md](docs/COMPARE.md) has the neighbours, the method, and where they are
ahead. "Nowhere else" means: not in anything we found, and the page lists what we read.

- **One verifier on Solana for any RS256 workload identity.** `knos-oidc` verifies an OpenID Connect token signed
  with RS256 on chain, and any other program can read the verified claims. GitHub's keys are built in. A key of
  any other issuer (GitLab, a company's own GitHub Enterprise Server, another CI system) is admitted on GitHub's
  signature over a pinned workflow run that fetched it, then waits a day and needs a guardian's approval. We found
  no other program on Solana that verifies an RS256, JWT or OIDC token. On an EVM chain MergePay verified GitHub's
  signature first.
- **Named checks as a condition of payment, fixed at funding.** The checks that must have passed at the merged
  commit, and the paths that may change, are hashed into the order when the money goes in. On MergePay the
  condition is the merge alone. On the bounty boards a person judges.
- **A payment the buyer cannot withhold after a merge.** On a public repository the seller can ask GitHub for the
  signed statement himself, from the same pinned workflow, and the program accepts it. In the products we read, the
  buyer or the board decides the payout.
- **Payment on a black-box check, by a program.** One board, TaskBounty, also pays on a test run, in a sandbox it
  operates. Here the sandbox is in the funder's workflow and a program pays.
- **A neutral count of accepted outcomes, on chain, with no escrow.** No vendor uses it yet.

## What runs today, and where

Everything is on **Solana devnet**, and the money is **test USDC**. Mainnet is not touched.

| program | address | state |
|---|---|---|
| `knos-oidc`, the verifier | `FkwZdsYCmzicJMtHLTkPK76bYNVG4WNwkWJBiVWNtF3W` | deployed as 0.3.12 left it; the upgrade to this release was proposed |
| `knos-pay`, the escrow | `5y7iWJ1VAMJjnnWbbdo2a2PsWJEwTExSNpzrvQSEnS8k` | the same |
| `knos-meter`, the count | `FUMKkcE95x2kZUj1zZTCbgcYBmJ3WXPHL8pyA8J6anX` | new in this release |
| `knos-passkey`, a wallet from a passkey | `FQPX9i5kQxLYKZyyPgM2fVK9am3w1LSk1Cuoer1sSY85` | new in this release |

The upgrade of `knos-oidc` and `knos-pay` was proposed and approved by the multisig on [[stat: upgrade_proposed]]. It
can execute from [[stat: upgrade_executable]], 48 hours later, and not before: that delay is the rule this project
asks its users to rely on, so it waits like anyone else. Until it executes, the two programs behave as 0.3.12
described them: a bounty's fee is taken from the payment, only the funder's repository can sign, and there is no
warranty, arbiter, split or standing order. Work orders, the seller's own settlement, any-issuer keys and single-use
pay tokens are live from the moment it executes. `knos status` and a banner on the site say whether an upgrade is
still pending. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists each feature with when it is live.

Knos can change all four programs only through a Squads multisig whose vault
(`CKCrTBN542pVhizxuSPVg8tvdnPooNxt9B7o97VuTjz2`) is their upgrade authority, and only after that public 48-hour
delay, until an outside review. Every member key of that multisig is still the founder's, so the delay, not the
number of signers, is what protects a user. A second multisig, the guardian
(`AT1aKj1DpgaWerxmS4YjDkNpWPNUtCCKVDvxLhFxg5Jc`), can approve or revoke a signing key and pause new funding for at
most 7 days. It cannot add a key or move money. The first deployment ([`programs`](programs), 0.3.10 and 0.3.11) has
no upgrade authority and stays as the record of those releases; nothing new is funded there.

No outside security firm has reviewed anything. Readers' reviews of 0.3.12 found defects, and this release fixes
them ([CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

## Install

[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) lists every route with its exact commands:

- **A repository:** the workflow file above, or only the free check as a GitHub Action.
- **A terminal:** `pip install knos`, then `knos --help`.
- **Coding agents:** `knos init` adds a Stop hook and an MCP server to the agents on the machine. There are also a
  plugin for Claude Code and Codex, an extension for Gemini CLI, and one-click links for Cursor and VS Code. The
  hook runs the check itself when an agent says tests pass or it is done. The MCP tools list funded work, check a
  pull request's claims, say whether a repository can still pay, and return the exact comment or transaction for
  taking, funding and settling. They hold no key and send nothing themselves.
- **Other programs:** Rust crates that read a verified token and fund a work order, the programs' IDLs, a
  JavaScript client, and worked examples ([docs/COMPOSE.md](docs/COMPOSE.md), [docs/OIDC.md](docs/OIDC.md)).

## Prices

[docs/MARKET.md](docs/MARKET.md) has the price book, what each sale costs to deliver, and what a fork takes.

- **Check:** free. The claim check, the Stop hook, the MCP tools, the Index and on-chain verification.
- **Settle:** the funder pays the amount plus 2.5%, at least 0.40 and at most 25 USDC. The payee receives the
  posted amount. 0.5% to 1.5% under a contract.
- **Meter:** 0.05 per billable evaluation, 0.02 at volume. The first 10,000 evaluations of a month are free.
- **Control:** policy as code, budgets, private repositories, statements, exports, screening. 25,000 USD a year,
  or 80,000 with a volume commitment. A contract price: nothing on chain enforces it, and nobody has bought it.
- **Advance:** a third party pays the seller at acceptance and takes the assigned payment. Knos charges nothing.

The repository's own three scenarios add up to 121,125 USD of fees a year. What 1 billion USD a year would
require is printed beside it in MARKET.md as arithmetic, not as a forecast.

## Limits

[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) has all of them. The ones to know first:

- **Devnet, test USDC, no outside review.** `knos mainnet-check` fails on that line on purpose.
- **Nothing has been bought by an outsider.** By 3 Oct 2026 no outside repository had funded a task. Knos's own
  account funded every task that was paid. The site's Numbers page shows today's counts.
- **A signature authenticates a statement, not the truth.** GitHub signs that a pinned workflow ran, not what it
  read. A funder's own repository that lies can pay whom it likes, from its own orders only.
- **The seller's own settlement covers public repositories.** For a private repository the buyer can still withhold
  by revoking access. What remains is the arbiter, if the order named one, and the public record.
- **A passed check is not good work.** An order buys what its terms say, and the funder chose the terms.
- **Knos inherits GitHub's failures.** If GitHub signs something false or is down, the programs believe it or wait.
- **One person can change the programs, after 48 hours,** until the outside review.
- **An order is capped at 500 USDC** until the review, and holds at least 5.
- **The payout is USDC on Solana.** There is no card, bank transfer or invoice payment in, and no bank payout.

## History

Knos 0.1 (1–7 Sep 2026, before this hackathon) was shared memory for coding agents built on Sibyl, and it won the
Sibyl Labs hackathon. 0.2 and 0.3.0–0.3.9 (29 Sep – 2 Oct) were built during this one and tried coordination,
budgets and a jobs market before the measurement above showed where the problem was. Those are kept in
[drexthealpha/knos-labs](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-labs). 0.3.10 and 0.3.11 were the first deployment,
made immutable before anyone outside had read it. 0.3.12 was the second deployment. 0.3.13 is this release: work
orders, the count, the passkey wallet and any issuer. [docs/DISCLOSURE.md](docs/DISCLOSURE.md) says what was built
when, what is older than the hackathon, and what came from elsewhere; [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is the dated
record.

MIT, all of it. Built by drexthealpha. Its memory engine is [Sibyl](https://sibyllabs.org).
